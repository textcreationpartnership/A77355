            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> (whom I take to be the Pen-man of this Epiſtle) having in the former part of this Chapter, ſhewed the Reaſons, why it behoved Chriſt for to ſuffer death: He comes now, in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end thereof, to give you an account, by laying down ſome Reaſons, <hi>Why it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:162405:14"/>behoved Chriſt, to be in all things made like unto us,</hi> whom the Apoſtle here cals the <hi>Brethren</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In other Scriptures we find, that our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, is called our Father, The everlaſting Father, the Prince of peace. Here he is called <hi>our Brother,</hi> we <hi>his Brethren.</hi> Now the ſame Perſon, to be both a Father, and a Brother unto the ſame man, in nature it cannot be.</p>
               <p>But becauſe all theſe Relations, are to ſcant, and narrow Veſſels to hold forth the love of Jeſus Chriſt towards us: Therefore Inconſiſtent Relations are given unto him. A Father Provides for his child, which the brother doth not. A Brother can ſtoop, and condeſend unto his brother, which the ſuperiority of the Father will not bear. So that here is held forth unto us, the ſtooping, Condeſending love of Jeſus Chriſt: and therfore he is called our Brother, and we his Brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But why,</hi>

                  <hi>That he might be a merciful, and a faithful high Prieſt, in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people, &amp;c.</hi> The Lord God our Father, ſwear unto Jeſus Chriſt, Thou art a Prieſt for ever, after the order of <hi>Melchizedek.</hi> He was to be the great high Prieſt. Among the Jews, in the times of the old Teſtament, they had an high Prieſt, that was in all things to ſtand between God and them, and in caſe any ſinned, to make an atonement for them. As the Jewes had their High Prieſt: So the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he was to be, and he is, <hi>The Apoſtle,</hi> and the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> of our Chriſtian profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was of the Jewes profeſſion. And therefore ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>It behoved him, in all things to be made like unto us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But could</hi> not Jeſus Chriſt be merciful unto poor tempted ſouls, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> unleſs he were in all things made like to them: like in their <hi>Natures,</hi> like in their <hi>Affections,</hi> like in <hi>matter of Temptations.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:162405:14"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt as God,</hi> could have been merciful unto us, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
                  </label> although he had not been made like unto us: <hi>but not as our High Prieſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is an ability of Sufficiency, and of Power: and ſo Chriſt as God, was able to ſuccour thoſe that are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, although himſelf had never been tempted. But there is an ability of Idoneity, or Fitneſs, or Aptneſs and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: and ſo the Apoſtle ſaies here, For in that Himſelf hath ſuffered being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</p>
               <p>It's plain then, what that is, that is the great ſupport of a Chriſtian againſt all Temptations: wherein lies our ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour againſt all Temptation, namely, in the Prieſtly-Office of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Prieſtly-Office of Chriſt, Is it the great Magazine, and Stonehouſe, of all that Grace, and Comfort which we have on this ſide Heaven: It is that, whereby we are reconciled to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and relieved againſt all temptation. This is the great thing that theſe words hold forth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, upon this account, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> finding the Hebrewes labouring under great Temptations, Doubtings, Fears, and much Unbeleef; he does not only here, but all along in this book of the Hebrews, open the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt unto them.</p>
               <p>And indeed, what comfort can we have in God Himſelf, but through Chriſt? and what comfort can we have in Chriſt Himſelf, but as he is cloathed with his Preſtly-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with his Office of the High Prieſt? Whatſoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort we have in the other Offices of Chriſt, namely his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and his <hi>Prophetical Office,</hi> it is all Originated, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiated <hi>in this:</hi> The Prieſtly Office of Jeſus Chriſt, it does give a Life, and Being, and Efficacy to both the other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And therefore, the High Prieſt, in the times of the old Teſtament, (who was a Type of Chriſt) he wore a Crown, upon his head, and the breaſt-plate of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim,</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> upon his breaſt: ſhowing, that both the other Offices, the Kingly, and the Prophetical Office, were planted upon the Prieſtly Office of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:162405:15"/>
               <p>Yea, If you look into the, Firſt, Second, and Third Chapters of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> you will find, that whatſoever ſtreames of comfort did run down upon the Churches through the other Titles, and Attributes of God, they are all fountain'd here. In the Second Chapter, and the firſt verſe. The Lord Chriſt hath this Title, That he holdeth the ſeven ſtars in his right hand! <hi>Theſe things ſaith he that holdeth the ſeven ſtars in his right hand.</hi> In the Eight verſe writing unto the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> he takes up another Title, or Attribute: <hi>Theſe things ſaith the firſt and the laſt, which was dead and is alive.</hi> At the Twelf verſe, writing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> he takes up another Title: <hi>Theſe things ſaith he, who hath the ſharp ſword with two edges.</hi> Now look into the firſt Chapter, and you ſhall ſee, that thoſe ſeveral Titles, wherewith he cloaths Himſelf when he ſpeaks unto the Churches ſeverally, are all ſummed up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the 16. verſe. <hi>And he had in his right hand ſeven ſtars;</hi> There's his Title unto the Church of <hi>Epheſus: And out of his mouth went a ſharp two-edged ſword:</hi> There's his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle unto the Church of <hi>Pergamus.</hi> And at the 18. verſe. <hi>I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive for ever more;</hi> There's another Title, that he uſeth when he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto the Church of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> But in the 13. verſ. is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the fountain of all theſe ſtreams: <hi>In the midſt of the ſeven candleſticks, I ſaw me like unto the Son of man, cloathed with a garment down to the foot; and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</hi> This was then the robe and attyre of the High Prieſt: Whoſe garment came down unto his feet, and he was girt about with a golden girdle. So that all theſe other Attributes, and Titles of Chriſt, they have their riſe here, here is the <hi>ſpring-head</hi> of all thoſe conſolations, even <hi>the Prieſtly Office of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Uſually, Thoſe Excellencies, and Attributes of Chriſt are moſt beneficial unto the Saints, that are moſt oppoſed by the world. What Title, Attribute; or Excellency of Chriſt is there, that is more invaded by the world, than the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:162405:15"/>Prieſtly office of Jeſus Chriſt? What is the whole body of Anti-chriſtianiſme, but an invaſion upon this Prieſtly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt? What is the <hi>Popiſh Maſſe,</hi> (that <hi>unbloody ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi>) but a derogation from the Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt once upon the Croſſe, and ſo a derogation from his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office? What are all thoſe Popiſh Penances, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions injoyn'd, but a derogation unto the ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo unto the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt? What is all their praying to Saints, and Angels, but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation unto the Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo unto the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt? What does the Pope call himſelf? He cals himſelf, <hi>the High Prieſt,</hi>

                     </gap>
                  </note> the very Title that our Lord, and Saviour takes unto himſelf. So that <hi>the whole body of Anti-chriſtianiſme, is a great invaſion upon the Prieſtly Office of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now that which is uſually oppoſed moſt by the men of the world, that Excellency, and that Attribute of Chriſt, is of all other the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and beneficial unto Gods people. The truth is, This Prieſtly Office of Jeſus Chriſt, is an Office of meer love, and tender compaſſion; erected, and ſet up on purpoſe, for the reliefe of poor diſtreſſed ſinners; and there is no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of terrour with it: there is a mixture of terrour with the other Offices of Chriſt. The Lord Chriſt, he is King, and he hath a Kingly Office, and by his Kingly. Office he rules over the Churches, and rules over all the world: But all do not obtain mercy that he rules over. <hi>As for thoſe mine Enemies, that will not ſubmit, will not have mee to Reign over them, bring them, and ſlay them before mee.</hi> The Prophetical office of Jeſus-Chriſt, it extendeth unto many that ſhall never be ſaved: <hi>Light ſhines in darkneſs, and darkneſſe comprehendeth it not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</hi> But now, where o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Prieſtly Office of Jeſus Chriſt is let forth upon an ſoul, that ſoul ſhall certainly be ſaved for ever.</p>
               <p>What was the great relief amongſt the Jewes againſt their ſins? The Jewes, you ſhall obſerve they had many reliefs: when they were in the wilderneſs, and were ſtung with the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:162405:16"/>fiery ſerpents, then they had a braſen-ſerpent for to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a reliefe againſt that diſtreſſe. When they wanted water, they had the water out of the Rock, as a reliefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that diſtreſſe. When they wanted Bread, they had Manna from Heaven, as a reliefe againſt that diſtreſs. But when they ſinned, whither did they go? Then they took a ſacrifice, and went unto the Prieſt, and he was to offer for them. So that the Prieſtly Office then, was the only relief they had againſt ſin.</p>
               <p>And ſo now, the Prieſtly Office of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it is that great ſuccour, and relief which Chriſtians have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Temptations under Heaven.</p>
               <p>You will ſay unto me, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> But generall things affect not: let us ſee it in ſome Particulars, <hi>wherein</hi> this Prieſtly Office of Chriſt, is the great Magazin, and Storehouſe of all our grace and comfort.</p>
               <p>For Anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
                  </label> hereunto, I will begin this exerciſe with one Particular of the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt, in ſhewing what a relief, and ſuccour <hi>it is</hi> unto a Chriſtian againſt all Temptations, and what a bottome of comfort, and ſpecial means of Grace and Holineſs.</p>
               <p>The text ſaies, That the <hi>work of the</hi> High Prieſt is, To make reconciliation for the ſins of the people. In the times of the old Teſtament, the High Prieſt made an Atonement for the people: in caſe any man had finned, he brought a ſacrifice, and his ſins were laid upon the head of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Once every yeer, the High Prieſt did enter into the holy of holieſt, and with the blood of the Sacrifice, did ſprinkle the Mercy-Seat, and laid the ſins of the people upon the head of the ſcape-goat and ſo made an atonement for the people. All which will cleerly appear, in that, 16. of <hi>Liviticus,</hi> at the 14. verſe. He ſhall take of the blood of the bullock, and ſprinkle it with his finger upon the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-Seat eaſt-ward: and before the Mercy-Seat ſhall be ſprinkle of the blood with his finger ſeven times. And at the 21. verſe. <hi>And Aaron ſhall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confeſſe over him all the iniquities of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:162405:16"/>of Iſrael, and all their tranſgreſſions, in all their ſins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and ſhall ſend him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderneſs, and ſo he ſhall make an atonement,</hi> as in that Chapter. This was the work of the High Prieſt, in caſe any had finned, to make an atonement, and ſatisfaction (by way of Type) for the ſins of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Now for the better proof of <hi>this great Goſpel-Truth</hi> that I have propounded, I ſhall inſiſt on theſe Five things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt died upon the Croſſe, he did offer up Himſelf a ſacrifice unto God the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That when this ſacrifice was upon the Altar, then the ſins of all beleevers, paſt, preſent, and to come, were all laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That when theſe ſins were thus laid upon Chriſt, he did thereby give full ſatisfaction unto God the Father, unto Divine Juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>That all this he did as our great High-Prieſt, and in a more Tranſcendent, and Eminent manner, then ever any High Prieſt did before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>How all this doth conduce to our Comfort, and to our Holineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>When our Lord Jeſus Chriſt died upon the Croſs, He did offer up himſelf a ſacrifice unto God the Father.</hi> He did not (as the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay) die only as an example for to teach us how to die; but he offered up himſelf a ſacrifice unto God the Father then. Yea, as if all ſacrifices were met in him; all thoſe titles that are given unto other Sacrifices, they are given unto him. There were Three ſorts of Sacrifices: ſome were living; others were not living, and thoſe were either ſolid, as bread and the like; or elſe, they were liquid, as wine and oyle. There was a alwaies, <hi>Deſtructio rei oblatiae,</hi> A deſtroying of the thing offered. If it were a living thing that was ſacrificed, then it was ſaid to be ſlain: In anſwer to that, Jeſus Chriſt is ſaid to be a Lamb ſlain from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world. If it were a dead thing that was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up, as bread, or corn, a ſolid thing, then the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:162405:17"/>or offering was ſaid to be bruiſed. In anſwer to that, our Lord and Saviour Chriſt is ſaid to be bruiſed for our iniquities. If it were a liquid thing that was offered up to God, as wine, or oyle, then it was ſaid to be powred out. In anſwer to this, it is ſaid of our Lord and Saviour, That his ſoul was powred out unto death. Thus all Sacrifices meeting in him. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God</hi> (ſaies <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt when he ſaw Chriſt.) He does not ſay, Behold the Bull of God, or the Goat of God; and yet Buls, and Goats were ſacrificed. Why does he rather ſay, behold the Lamb of God, than the Bullock, or the Goat? For when the High Prieſt went into the Holy of Holieſt, and ſprinkled the Mercy-Seat, he did not ſprinkle the Mercy-Seat with the blood of the Lamb, but with the blood of a Goat; and yet notwithſtanding, it is not ſaid, Behold the Goat of God, but, Behold the Lamb of God: Why ſo? Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe that Chriſt was of a lamb-like, and meek diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition (as ſome would have it:) Nor only becauſe, that the great Type of Chriſt, was the Paſcal-Lamb, (though theſe be reaſons.) But there was a dayly ſacrifice in the Temple; whether men brought any offering or no, there was a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſacrifice in the Temple, morning, and evening, and that ſacrifice was a Lamb. Now therefore, to ſhew, that Jeſus Chriſt is the dayly ſacrifice, therefore he cries out, and ſaies, Behold the Lamb of God, and not the Goat of God; for the Goat was not ſacrificed every day as the Lamb was.</p>
               <p>For proof of this, take the Apoſtles Exhortation, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Walk in love, as Chriſt hath loved us, and hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us, an offering, and a ſacrifice to God.</hi> Here are Three things conſiderable. Firſt, He does not ſay, <hi>Who hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us:</hi> but, to ſhow his great love unto us, <hi>Who hath given himſelf for us:</hi> He doth not ſay, <hi>Who hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for our ſins:</hi> Yet he ſaies ſo, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Who gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for our ſins;</hi> But, <hi>Who gave himſelf for us.</hi> Why? To ſhew, who they were that he gave himſelf for: He gave himſelf for us, as ſinners. Again, He ſaies here, He gave
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:162405:17"/>himſelf for us, an offering, and a ſacrifice, not only an offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but a ſacrifice too. So that this firſt Propoſition is cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved, That our Lord Jeſus, <hi>when he died upon the Croſſe, he did offer up himſelf as a ſacrifice unto God the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As he did offer up himſelf a ſacrifice unto God the Father: <hi>So when he was upon this Altar, this ſacrifice; the ſins of all beleevers were then laid upon Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> thoſe that do now beleeve, or ſhall hereafter beleeve, they were all then laid upon Jeſus Chriſt. Look into the 53. of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ver. 6. <hi>All we like ſheep have gone aſtray, and have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all.</hi> That which God laies on ſhall never be taken off, no man ſhall take it off: The <hi>Lord</hi> hath laid on him the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquities of us all.</p>
               <p>Yea, Our iniquities are not only ſaid to be laid on him, but (to uſe the ſame word that is uſed for the ſacrifice) it is ſaid, he bare our ſins upon the Croſſe; as the Goat bare the ſins of the people: So ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>He himſelf bare our ſins upon the Croſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, He did not only bare our ſins upon the Croſs: but (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>he was made ſin for us.</hi> 'Tis not ſaid, He was made a ſinner, or accounted a ſinner only for us, but he was made ſin for us. All our iniquities were laid on him; he bare our ſins; and he was made ſin for us upon the Croſſe. Thus briefly the Second Propoſition is cleared, <hi>That when he did thus offer up himſelf upon the Croſſe as a ſacrifice, the ſins of all beleevers were then laid on him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>When the ſins of beleevers were laid on him,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>then he did make full ſatisfaction unto God the Father, and Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for all our ſins.</hi> This is a bottom of much comfort. For if the Lord Jeſus Chriſt our ſurety had not ſatisfied to the utmoſt farthing, our great Creditor, God the Father, for all our debts, God the Father might come upon us the Debters. But our Surety, the Lord Chriſt, hath given full ſatisfaction unto God the Father, that no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands can be made upon us: And indeed elſe, how could our Surety ever have come out of priſon: He was under ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:162405:18"/>he was in the Jayle, in the grave: The Father, the great Creditor lets him out; and did not only let him out, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he goes inbto Heaven, and ſits down there at the right hand of the Father; Surely, if the Creditor had not been ſatisfied, the Surety ſhould never have bin releaſed out of priſon.</p>
               <p>He was ſo fully ſatisfied, That <hi>he looked for iniquity, and he found none,</hi> (ſaies the text.) He look't over all his books, to ſee if he could find any thing upon the ſcore, but he found none: all our debts were paid. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the ſin of the world.</hi> He does not ſay, That takes away the ſin of the Jewes only; but takes away the ſin of the whole world. He does not ſay, That takes away the ſins, (in the plural Number) but takes away the <hi>ſin</hi>) (in the ſingular Number:) Sins go ſo together, as if they were but one: but let the ſin be never ſo twiſted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as if it were but one ſin, this lamb of God, he takes away the ſin of the world. And he does not ſay, That hath pardoned the ſin of the World: for then a poor ſoul might ſay, I but, though he hath pardon'd my ſin, yet my ſin is not mortified. Neither does he ſay, Behold the lamb of God that Mortifies, or Deſtroyes the ſin of the world: But he gives you a word, that takes in, both pardon, and Mortification too. Behold the lamb of God that takes them away: both in regard of Pardon, and in regard of Mortification: <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the ſin of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is nothing that does ſo ſatisfie God the Father, as Obedience, and the more full the Obedience is, the more God the Father is ſatisfied thereby: Now it is ſaid of our Lord and ſaviour Chriſt, That in this great ſacrifice upon the Croſſe, he was Obedient. <hi>He was Obedient even to the death of the Croſs.</hi> That he that did make the Law, ſhould come down from Heaven, and be ſubject to the Law, what Obedience was here! <hi>Obedient to the Death.</hi> Yea, unto the <hi>Deaths</hi> (in the plural Number) And he made his grave with the ſinners: and his <hi>Deaths</hi> was with the rich. <hi>He made
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:162405:18"/>his grave with the wicked, and with the rich had his Deaths, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah,</hi> 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ver. 9. It is in the Plural Number in the Hebrew, though in your Engliſh tranſlation it is in the Singular. As if the holy Ghoſt had called death, the Second death that our Lord Chriſt had in ſome meaſure ſuffered. For, if you conſider things truly, and rightly, I beleeve you will find, that our Lord and Saviour Chriſt when he died, and was in his agony, he did not only indure the firſt, but the torments of the ſecond death. He overcame no more than he ſubmitted to: he overcame death by ſubmitting to death. Now he overcame the ſecond death alſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſome meaſure ſubmitted to the torments of it, ſo far as he was capable. Look what the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have indured for his ſin in the fall, that the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> now did indure in ſome meaſure for to take it off: <hi>The day that thou eateſt thou ſhalt die the death.</hi> It was not barely the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and outward death, but it was the ſecond death. If our Lord and Saviour Chriſt did not indure the torments of the ſecond death, the wrath of God upon his ſoul; why did he ſweat drops of blood, and tremble, and ſhake ſo, when he came to die? There is many Saints, and Martyrs, when they come to die, they go skipping, and leaping, and rejoycing: and our Lord and Saviour, when he came to die, he ſweats drops of blood; ſurely there was more than an outward death: Oh! the wrath of God, and the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſecond death was upon his ſoul. Thus obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent he was, and this obedience of his, it was volontary, for he needed not to have died; but he ſaw that God the father was diſhonoured by mans ſin, and that poor man would be loſt, and rather than that ſhould be, he does volontarily offer himſelf unto this Obedience. <hi>Loe, I come</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>in the volum of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, and thy Law is within my heart, Pſal.</hi> 40.7, 8. Mark what an expreſſion there is in that <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 'tis ſpoken concering Chriſt, as is plainly interpreted by the Apoſtle in the 10. of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> at the 6. verſe. <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou didſt not deſire, mine eares haſt thou opened (or bored.)</hi> The Apoſtle
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:162405:19"/>when he tranſlates theſe words, he tranſlates them thus: <hi>My body haſt thou prepared.</hi> But reade them as they are here in the <hi>Pſalm: Sacrifice and offring thou didſt not deſire, mine eare hath thou bored.</hi> That as when a ſervant was willing to ſtay with his Maſter, and to do him yet more ſervice, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants eare was to be bored: So ſaies the Lord Chriſt, I am as willing to do this work, to be thus obedient, as a ſervant whoſe eare is bored, is willing to ſtay with his maſter: And mine eare haſt thou bored, (ſaies he) ah, here's obedience, here's obedience: this now did infinitly ſatisfie God the Father; In ſo much, that ye may ſee what is ſaid, in that ſame 5. of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and the 2. verſe. <hi>Who hath loved us, and given himſelf for us, an offering, and a ſacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi> The whol world it was ful of a ſtench before, and the Lord was diſpleaſed with man before: but now when Chriſt comes, and offers up this ſacrifice, he did thereby give full ſatisfction unto God the father, for it was a ſweet ſwelling-ſavour unto God the Father. So that thus the Father he was fully ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>To this I ſhall ad one word; <hi>When the Lord Jeſus Chriſt offered up himſelf a ſacrifice unto God the Father, and had our ſins laid upon him, he did given more perfect ſatisfaction unto Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine juſtice for our ſins; than if you, and I, and all of us had been damned in Hell unto all eternity.</hi> For a Creditor is more ſatisfied, if his debt be paid him all down at once, than if it be paid by the week: A poor man that cannot pay all down, will pay a groat a week, or ſixpence a week; but 'tis more ſatisfaction to the Creditor to have all paid at once. Should we have been all damned, we ſhould have been but paying the debt a little, and a little, and a little: but when Chriſt paid it, he paid it all down to God the Father. Had we gone to Hell, and been damned for ever, we had alwaies been ſatisfying of God, I but God had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been ſatisfied: but now when Chriſt makes ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, God was ſatisfied. The Creditor, if he be a merciful and a good man, is more truly ſatisfied where the Debter is ſpared; he does not deſire that the Debter ſhould be caſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:162405:19"/>into priſon, and there lie and rot; but he is better ſatisfied with the ſparing of the Debter; let me have but my Money, and ſo the Debter be ſpared I am willing, nay I deſire it ſaies the good Creditor. Now if all we had bin caſt into everlaſting burnings, indeed the debt ſhould have been a paying, but there the Debter had been loſt: But not when Chriſt comes, and makes ſatisfaction unto Divine juſtice, Ah! poor man is redeemed; here is the Debter ſpared. And therefore, the Lord he is infinitly more ſatisfied, by the ſatisfaction that Chriſt made upon the Croſs for our ſins, than if all we had gone to Hell, and been damned to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. Oh! what a glorious, and bleſſed ſatisfaction did this our High-Prieſt make unto God the Father!</p>
               <p>But you will ſay then, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> 
                  <hi>If the Lord Chriſt made this full ſatisfaction unto God the Father; how is it that Beleevers, many of them have their ſins, and debts ſtanding upon the ſcore ſtill, in their Conſciences, ſo perplexed in regard of ſin, as if there were no ſatisfaction at all made?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But the reaſon of it is this, Becauſe that men do not ſtudy this Truth, but was ignorant of it. As, ſuppoſe that a man do owe, three or four hundred pound to a ſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, for wares, and commodities that he hath taken up there: a friend comes, and he payes the debt, croſſes the book: but the Debter, when he comes and looks upon the book, he is able to reade all the particulars; Item; for ſuch a thing, and Item for ſuch a thing, and Item, for ſuch a thing; but the man being not aquainted with the nature of croſſing the book, he is able to reade all th particulars, and he charges it ſtill upon himſelfe, becauſe he does not underſtand the nature of this croſſing the book, and he is as much troubled how he ſhall pay the debt, as if it were
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:162405:20"/>not paid at all. So now 'tis here, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he hath come and croſſ't our book with his own blood: the ſins are to be read in your own conſciences, but we being not acquainted with the nature of Chriſts ſatisfaction, and the croſſing of the book, we charge our ſelves, as if no ſin at all were ſatisfied for us: Yet when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was made an offering for ſin upon the Croſs, then he did give full ſatisfaction unto God the Father. And that's the Third.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                  <hi>This now he hath done as our great High-Prieſt, and in a more tranſcendant, and eminent way, than ever any high-Prieſt did before.</hi> For, though the High-Prieſt did come, and make an atonement for a poor ſinner, yet he himſelf was never made a ſacrifice; the Prieſt offered up a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but himſelf never was made a ſacrifice. But our great High-Prieſt, does not only offer up a ſacrifice, but Himſelf is made a ſacrifice. Yea, that ſacrifice, that was then in the times of the old-Teſtament, it could not purge the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; not only, becauſe (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) it was the blood of bulls, and goats: but becauſe the ſacrifice was performed ſucceſſively; as thus, A man ſinned, then he brought a ſacrifice; ſins again, and then he brings another ſicrifice: and once every yeare, the High-Prieſt goes into the holy of holieſt to make an atonement: But in the mean while, a poor ſoul might think thus, What if I die before the year come about, what will become of me? the High-Prieſt, he goes once a year into the Holy of Holyeſt, and ſprinkles the mercy-ſeat, but what will become of me if I die before that time? But now, our great High-Prieſt, he does not only offer up a ſacrifice, and Himſelf the ſacrifice; but he offers up a ſacrifice <hi>once</hi> for all. (So ſaies the Apoſtle) So that now, when a Chriſtian hath ſinned, he is not to think of a ſacrifice that is yet to come, a year hence, but he is to look unto that which is done already, a ſacrifice <hi>once offered,</hi> and <hi>once for all;</hi> So that he needs not be in ſuſpence now, as the Jewes were, his Conſcience, it may be fully purged from ſin.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:162405:20"/>
               <p>Again, Take the High-Prieſt in the times of the old-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and though he did make an atonement for the ſins of the people;yet ſometimes alſo he did make the people to ſin. It is ſaid of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the great <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the golden-Calf, that he did make the <hi>people naked:</hi> But the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, our great High-Prieſt, he makes an attonement for ſin, and never does make them ſin: He is ſo far from making the people naked, that he covers them with his righteouſneſs that their nakedneſs may not appear. Here's a glorious High-Prieſt!</p>
               <p>Yea, This High-Prieſt of ours, He does not only make an atonement for ſin committed, and paies the debt; but he does alſo become our Surety unto God the Father: He does not only pay the debt that is paſt, but he becomes a Surety for time to come. None of all thoſe High-Prieſts, that ever did ſo; not <hi>Aaron,</hi> not any High-Prieſt that ever gave his bond unto God the Father, that any ſinner ſhould never ſin no more. But our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, our High-Prieſt, he becomes our Surety: and what Surety? not an ordinary ſurety; for amongſt us, the Surety joyns, and does become bound with the Debter, but ſtill it runs in the name of the Debter, and the Debter he gives the bond for to pay the debt. But now here, our Surety, he gives the bond, and we that are the Debters, we do not give the bond for to pay the debt: there is no godly man, or beleever, that ever gave a bond unto God the Father, that he will pay the debt: but our Surety comes, and the bond goes in the name of the Surety, and the Debters name is out. Oh! what a glorious, and bleſſed High-Prieſt is here! here is a High-Prieſt, beyond all the High-Prieſts that ever did go before! And that's the Fourth thing</p>

               <p>Again, If the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ſatisfied for my ſins (may a beleever ſay) then I ſhall never be Damned, I ſhall never fall from grace. I have had many fears, that I ſhould fall from grace, and ſo go to Hell, and periſh at laſt: But if the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ſatisfied Divine Juſtice for my ſin, then God the father will never puniſh my ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, for it was puniſh't in Jeſus Chriſt, therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall from grace, therefore I can never be Damned.</p>

A debtor, ſo long as his debt is unpaid, he dares not come by the priſon door, by the Compter door; he is afraid of every Sergeant, he is afraid of his friends, that they ſhould be Sergeants: but when his debt is paid, then he dares go up and down with boldneſs.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>4</label> If that a poor Chriſtian now, might not to unto Jeſus Chriſt as unto his High-Prieſt, and ſay, that he is an High-Prieſt to me: then are we Chriſtians, in a great deal worſer condition than the Jews were; for when a Jew had ſinned, he might carry his ſacrifice to the Prieſt, and he might ſay, That this Prieſt here belongs to me. And there was never a Jew, amongſt all the people of the Jewes, but when the High-Prieſt ſprinkled the Mercy-Seat, but he might ſay, This he hath done for me. Now, we are not in a worſe condition, than the Jews were: this High-Prieſt, is beyond all the High-Prieſts that ever was before him: and therefore there is never a poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but he may go to the Lord Chriſt and ſay, Oh! my High-Prieſt, and this my High-Prieſt hath ſatisfied for me. Oh! what comfort is here to poor drooping ſouls! Lift up your heads, O all ye Saints, and Children of God; me thinks here is that indeed, that might bring you off your own ſands. When there is no water in the river but his own, the tyde comes not in, no ſea-water, only the water of the river, the native water, (as I may ſo ſpeak) then your bottoms, your ſhips they ſtand upon the ſands; but when the tyde comes in, then they are raiſed, and come off the ſands then: And ſo long as thou haſt nothing in thy own channel, but thine own righteouſneſs, thou ſtickeſt upon the ſands in the deep mire; But now, when the tyde of the Lords ſatisfaction comes in, there is a full-ſea of mercy, and ſatisfaction (able to ſwim the heavieſt veſſel) made by Jeſus Chriſt. Ah, me thinks this ſhould lift up a poor ſoul and fetch him off from his ſands: Be of good Comfort them. Thus it's evident how this truth does much conduce to our Comfort. But you will ſay, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:162405:22"/>You ſhall obſerve, that the new Covenant of grace, it is laid, and founded, upo the ſatisfaction of jeſus Chriſt upopn the Croſſe, upon that oblation. Three times, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> makes mention of the new Covenant of grace in the book of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the 8, 9, and 10. Chapters: and in all theſe places he laies the Covenant of grace, and founds it upon the ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt. But eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, in the 9. Chapter, the 13, 14, and 15. verſes. The 14. <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your conſcience from dead works, to ſerve the living God.</hi> Then at the 15. <hi>And for this cauſe, he is the Mediator of the new Teſtament. For this cauſe:</hi> plainly laying the new Covenant of grace, upon the ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt, upon this part of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office. So then, thou maieſt now go unto God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſay, Lord, thou haſt made a Covenant of grace with poor man, and this Covenant of grace is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prieſtly Office, and ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt; and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt he hath ſatisfied for me; and the new Covenant promiſes; <hi>that we ſhall be all taught of God:</hi> Lord, I amignorant, Oh! therefore now, by the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt let me be taught of thee, that I may be made wiſe unto ſalvation. And ſo again, Lord, thou haſt made a Covenant of grace with poor man; this is laid upon the ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt: The Covenant of grace ſaies, <hi>I will write my Law in your inward parts:</hi> Now, O Lord, ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt hath founded this Covenant in his blood, and I am one of thoſe that he hath made ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for; Oh! write thy Law in my inward parts that I may do all thy wills.</p>
               <p>But again, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> (in the Second place) that we may ſee how this do conduce to our Holineſs: Strengthen faith, and we ſtrengthen all: if faith be weakened, all grace is weakened: Strengthen your faith, and you ſtrengthen all your Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all your Graces. The way to ſtrengthen a bough, or a branch of the tree, is not to carry dung up into the tree, but to lay it to the root: Strengthen the root,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:162405:23"/>and ye ſtrengthen all the branches. Faith is the Root-grace: now the knowledge, and the thorow degeſting of this truth, <hi>That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is our great High-Prieſt, in this point of ſatisfaction,</hi> it does wonderfull ſtrengthen our faith. For, the more I know that God is willing, and and Chriſt willing to ſhew mercy unto me, the more my faith is ſtrengthened: I know this, That every man is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do the work of his office, if he be faithful: A Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is willing to carry a burden; why? becauſe it is his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to do it. It is the office of Jeſus Chriſt, for to bear our ſins: It is his Office to be the great High-Prieſt, that does ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie God the Father for our ſins: Surely therefore, he is willing to do it, for he is faithful in his office. But beſides, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>3</label> 
                  <hi>The more I ſee an holy Neceſſity upon Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, for to ſhow mercy to me, the more my faith riſes.</hi> (It's very remarkable) The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as God, he may refuſe, and might refuſe, whether he would ſhow mercy to us or no: But now, as a High-Prieſt, he cannot refuſe a poor ſinner that does come unto him. If I know that Chriſt is able to ſatisfie, is able to ſhow mercy to me, my faith ſtirs a little, at the ſight of Chriſts ability; If I know that Chriſt be willing to ſhow mercy to me, my faith riſes higher: but if I know, that Chriſt cannot refuſe me, if I do come unto him, then my faith riſes up to a great height indeed. When a poor ſinner amongſt the Jews, had ſinned, and brought his ſacrifice to the High-Prieſt, the Prieſt might not refuſe it: Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is our great High-Prieſt; I ſay, as God he may refuſe, but now, he being our great High-Prieſt, therefore when a poor ſinner comes to Jeſus Chriſt, as a High-Prieſt he cannot refuſe: Oh! what a great ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening is this to faith! Strengthen faith, and you ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then all: the right underſtanding of this truth, doth wonderfully ſtrengthen faith.</p>
               <p>Further, <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>The more a man is ingaged to Jeſus Chriſt, and takes himſelf to be ingaged to him, the more Holy he is: the more a man ſees himſelf freed from ſin by Chriſt, the more he takes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ingaged to Chriſt, for freeing of him from his ſin.</hi> Now
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:162405:23"/>this truth tels us how Chriſt hath ſatisfied for our ſins, freed us from ſin; and ſo we ſhall be the more ingaged to Chriſt. If a man were going to priſon, even at the Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter door, for a great ſum of money; and the door were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locking: if a man ſhould come and ſpeak to the Sergeant, Hold your hands, here is money for you, I will pay this mans debt, and laies the money down; would not this poor debtor take himſelf for ever ingaged to that man, that ſhould thus come, and lay down the money, and free him ſo ſeaſonably from the Compter, and priſon? Thus it was with the Lord Chriſt; Ah, we were all going to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, everlaſting priſon, chains of darkneſs, and he comes; and laies down the money, makes full ſatisfaction to God the Father as our great High-Prieſt: Oh! what an ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this to every ſoul unto the Lord Chriſt, to become the Lord Chriſts for ever.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>The more a man does deny his own righteouſneſs,</hi>

                  <hi>the more Holy he is with Goſpel-Holineſs.</hi> It is ſaid of the Jewes, That they going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, ſubmitted not unto the righteouſneſs of Chriſt. So on the contrary; when a man does go about to eſtabliſh the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, then he ſubmits unto it, and then he denies his own righteouſneſs. The more we ſee a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſatisfaction made by Jeſus Chriſt, for all our ſins, unto God the Father, the more we acknowledge Chriſts righteouſneſs, and the more we eſtabliſh it, and the more we ſhall be brought off from all our own righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Oh! Therefore now, as ever you do deſire, to have more Grace, more Holineſs, more Comfort; ſtudy, and ſtudy much this Prieſtly office of Jeſus Chriſt. There are many that complain, that they cannot profit under the means of grace: That they have hard hearts: That the waies, and Ordinances of God are not ſweet to them; Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer they do perform, but with no ſweetneſs, they do not reliſh the blood and Spirit of Chriſt upon their ſpirits in their duties, &amp;c. Many complain that their ſins, and temptations (like the ſons of <hi>Zarviah</hi>) are too mighty for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:162405:24"/>them, and that one day they ſhall be ſlain by the hand of <hi>Saul,</hi> ſuch a luſt, ſuch a corruption. No wonder that we have theſe complaints, when we do not go unto the ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of comfort, and grace that the Lord hath ſet open for us. The Prieſtly office of Chriſt, it is the great Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine, and Storehouſe, of all that grace, and comfort which we have on this ſide heaven: if ye do not go unto it, is it any wonder that ye want comfort, or that ye want grace? I appeal to you now; are there not ſome nay, many that never went to Jeſus Chriſt as their High-Prieſt to this day? Ah, are there not ſome even Profeſſors, that do not know what the Prieſtly Office of Jeſus Chriſt meanes? Oh! No wonder (poor ſoule) ſo uncomfortable, no more ſtength againſt thy temptations. If the State ſhould appoint a man for to relieve poor, maimed ſouldiers, that go a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging: if they meet with the ſawme man that is appointed by the State, and they beg of him in the ſtreets as an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, he relieves them not: but now, if they come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as a man appointed by the State for relief of ſuch, then he relieves them according to the duty of his place. So it is with men, they go to Chriſt in an ordinary way, they do not go to Chriſt as the great Lord Treaſurer of all our grace, as our great High-Prieſt, they do not go unto him as in office, ſet up in office by God the Father for ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe: they do not addreſſe themſelves to him as their High-Prieſt to make ſatisfaction for them, and therefore they go away and have no relief. But would we have more ſtrength againſt corruption? would we walk more comfortably in our courſe? would we find the waies of God, Ordinances, and duties more ſweet and comfortable to our ſouls? then reade, and conſider that place in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> 2.3. <hi>As the apple-tree among the treesof the wood, ſo is my beloved among the ſons: I ſate down under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet unto my taſt.</hi> The ſpouſe ſpeaks it concerning Chriſt. What is this fruit of Chriſt? Your Juſtification, Adoption, Vocation, Sanctification, Conſolation, it is al the fruit of Chriſt: All your own Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:162405:24"/>your Prayers, Reading, Meditation, they are all the fruit of Chriſt: The injoyment of al his Ordinances, &amp; al your ſpiritual priviledges under the Goſpel, they are the fruit of Chriſt. Now ſaies ſhe, <hi>I ſate down under his ſhadow, and his fruit, it was ſweet unto my taſt.</hi> As it is unto a man that does love fruit; be it Pears, Apples, Cherries, or the like: I love this fruit (ſaies he) but yet notwithſtanding, I muſt needs go where this fruit grows, and gather it off the tree; and when he hath gone to the tree, and taken the fruit off the tree, (ſaies he) I ſate down under the tree. I had not the fruit, the Apple, or Cherry, brought unto my houſe, but I went unto the tree, and gathered it off the tree; and I ſate down under the ſhadow of the tree, and Oh! how ſweet was the fruit unto me! So ſaies the ſoul, ſo ſaies the Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt: I ſate down under the ſhadow of Jeſus Chriſt, and then his fruit was ſweet unto my taſt. It may be we have had other ſhadows: we have ſate down under the ſhadow of our Eſtate, our outward Eſtate hath been ſweet unto our taſt. We have ſate down (it may be) under the ſhadow of friendſhip, and the fruit of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath been ſweet unto our taſt; But behold here a tree, the tree of life, whoſe ſhadow reaches to the end of the earth; Ah, Come, Come and ſit down under the ſhadow of Jeſus Chriſt. If there be ever a poor ſoul, that never yet knew what Comfort meant; Ah, Come, Come under the ſhadow of the Lord Jeſus; The Prieſtly Office of Jeſus Chriſt, it hath a very ſweet ſhadow; Come therefore, you that ſay you cannot profit under the means, and you that complain of ſuch, and ſuch temptations, and ſuch and ſuch ſins; and that you were never yet comforted, your conſciences never pacified: Come now, and ſit down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. I tell thee, from the Lord, thus fruit of His, it ſhall be ſweet unto thy taſt: thou ſhalt go to Prayer, and Prayer ſhall be ſweet unto thy ſoul, though heretofore thou couldſt find no ſweetneſs in it; ſo the Word and other Ordinances ſhall be ſweeter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee than the hony or the hony combe.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:162405:25"/>
               <p>Thus it's evident how comfortable the Prieſtly Office of Jeſus Chriſts, and how much conducing unto our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and Holineſs: Oh! therefore let us ſtudy, now ſtudy the Prieſtly Office of Jeſus Chriſt, and come and ſit down under his ſhadow, and the Lord make his fruit ſweet unto all our ſouls.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have begun to diſcover from theſe words, That the Frieſtly Office of Jeſus Chriſt, is the great Magazine, and Storehouſe, of all that grace, and comfort which we have in this world: that whereby we are ſuccoured, and relieved againſt all Temptations. This hath been made good in the <hi>Generall;</hi> and in <hi>one Particular</hi> work of the High Prieſt.</p>
               <p>If we now inquire further, what the work of the High-Prieſt was, and is, that accordingly we may addreſs our ſelves unto Jeſus Chriſt for ſuccour. We ſhall find, that it is alſo, to <hi>Pray,</hi> and <hi>Intercede</hi> for the people. <hi>To make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for the ſins of the people,</hi> (ſaies the text) <hi>To make A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for the ſins of the people,</hi> (ſaies the old Teſtament.) Which <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> or <hi>Atonement,</hi> was made in the times of the old Teſtament, not only by offering of a ſacrifice, but by taking the blood thereof, and preſenting that with Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:162405:26"/>and interceſſions, unto God, to accept of it for the ſins of the people. As we ſhall find, in that ſame 16. of <hi>Livitieus:</hi> After the ſacrifice was kild, the Prieſt was to take the blood of it, and ſprinkle it with his finger upon the Mercy-Seat; as we reade in the 14. verſe. And at the 12. and 13. <hi>He ſhall take a Cenſer full of burning coals of fire from off the Alter before the Lord, and his hands full of ſweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe beaten ſmall, and bring it within the vaile; And he ſhall put the incenſe upon the fire before the Lord, that the cloud of the incenſe may cover the Mercy-Seat.</hi> He was to cauſe a cloud of incenſe to ariſe upon the Mercy-Seat. All which was a great Type of the Prayers, and Interceſſions of Jeſus Chriſt: who having once offered up himſelf a ſacrifice for our ſins, hath carried the blood, and the vertue of it into Heaven, there ſprinkled the Mercy-Seat, and there ſtill by his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions does appear for us; As it is proved at large, in the 9. Chapter of this Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> 11. and 12 verſes: <hi>But Chriſt being come an High-Prieſt of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to ſay, not of this building: Neither by the blood of goats and calves: but by his own blood be entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternall redemption for us.</hi> And at the 24. verſe: <hi>For Chriſt is not entered into the Holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us.</hi> And if you duely conſider this book of the Hebrews, you will find, that this work of Chriſts Interceſſion, is The Eſſential work of his Prieſtly-Office: it ſeems rather to go beyond the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, than to fall ſhort of it. <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the 8. Chapter and the 4. verſe. <hi>For if he were on earth, he ſhould not be a Prieſt.</hi> That is, look as it was in the times of the old Teſtament: if the Prieſt had only offered a ſacrifice, and had not gone into the holy of holieſt with the blood thereof, ſprinkling the Mercy-Seat, praying, and interceding that it might be accepted for the ſins of the people, the Prieſt had not done the work of the Prieſt, and ſo he had not been a compleat Prieſt: So now, (ſaies the Apoſtle) if Jeſus Chriſt had only
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:162405:26"/>offred up himſelf here a ſacrifice, and had not gone into Heaven, the holy of holieſt, and carried the power and the vertue of his death thither, to pray and intercede for us, he had not done the work of the great High-Prieſt. Every Prieſt might ſacrifice, but every Prieſt might not go into the Holy of Holieſt, that belonged only to the High-Prieſt to do. Now therefore, Jeſus Chriſt going into Heaven, the Holy of Holieſt, there to make Interceſſion for us, is the great, and the ſpecial work of this High-Prieſt.</p>

Chapter of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the 24. verſe. <hi>Chriſt is not entred into the holy place made with hands, but into Heaven, now to appear in the preſence of God for us.</hi> He does not in an ordinary way, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner appear for us in Heaven; but with an <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> he does openly, and publickly, before all the Saints and Angels, appear for us in the preſence of God the Father. It is a comfort unto a man, ſometimes, to have a good friend at Court, at the Kings elbow, that may own him, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for him: but though a man have a friend at Court, ſometimes if there be any danger, he will not appear, and own a man; it may be he will own him, and countenance
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:162405:27"/>his Cauſe as long as there is no danger, but no longer. But now, here, we have a friend in Heaven, that will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for us, and own our Cauſes, and our ſouls, and in all conditions appear for us. That is the Firſt.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> He doth not only appear for us; but by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Prieſtly Office, he does carry the power, merit, and vertue of his blood into the preſence of God the Father in Heaven, and ſprinkles the Mercy-Seat with it ſeven times. Seven is a note of Perfection. Thoſe that Chriſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for, he does Intercede for. He takes all their bonds, and he carries them in unto God the Father, and he ſaies, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I have paid theſe bonds, I have paid this debt, I have ſatisfied thy Juſtice for theſe poor ſinners; and now my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is, that they may be acquitted from theſe bonds, and from theſe debts.

               <p>Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>3</label> He doth not only carry the power, and vertue of his blood, and preſent it to God the Father for our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge: but he does alſo plead our Cauſe in Heaven, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering unto all thoſe accuſations that are brought againſt us. And therefore we may reade what the Apoſtle ſaies in the 8. of the <hi>Rom.</hi> 33. ver. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that juſtifies, who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that died, yea, rather that he is riſen again, who is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us.</hi> Upon this ground the Apoſtle ſpeaks thus; Who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them? Jeſus Chriſt is at the right hand of God the Father, to take off all accuſations, that ſhall be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Let the World condemn, let <hi>Moſes</hi> condemn, let Satan condemn; Jeſus Chriſt is at the right hand of God the Father, to take off all accuſations that ſhall be raiſed againſt them. Concerning this there is a clear and full inſtance in that notable Scripture the 3. Chapter of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah,</hi> and the 1. verſe, We find Satan ſtanding at the right hand of <hi>Joſhua</hi> to reſiſt him. <hi>He ſhewed me</hi> Joſhua <hi>the High-Prieſt, ſtanding before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan ſtanding at his right band to reſiſt him.</hi> It was the cuſtome of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:162405:27"/>the Accuſer, to ſtand at the right hand of the accuſed: <hi>Pſalme,</hi> 109. ver. 6. <hi>Set thou a wicked man over him, and let Satan ſtand at his right hand:</hi> take the wall of him in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, condemning of him. Now here Satan-ſtanding at <hi>Joſhua's</hi> right hand, notes his accuſing of him. Well, what was the matter that he accuſed him of? Ye ſhall find that there was matter, verſe the 3. <hi>Now</hi> Joſhua <hi>was cloathed with filthy garments, and ſtood before the Angel.</hi> Satan came and accuſed him that he had filthy garments; and ſo he had: for the Prieſts, had defiled themſelves in Babylon, in marrying of ſtrange wives, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> and his children are charged, in the 10. Chapter of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the 18. verſe. (Give me leave a little to open this charge of Satan, that we may ſee Satan had matter of Charge, and accuſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Joſhua</hi>) <hi>And among the ſons of the Prieſts, there were found that had taken ſtrange wives: namely of the ſons of</hi> Joſhua. <hi>He was High-Prieſt.</hi> So that now, <hi>Joſhua</hi> had defiled his garments: thre was then matter of accuſation for Satan to work upon. But now, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, our great High-Prieſt ſteps in, and takes off this accuſation: The Lord ſaid (at the 3. of <hi>Zachariah,</hi> 2. verſe) unto Satan, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, even the Lord that hath choſen Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem rebuke thee.</hi> The word uſed by the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> is the ſame that is uſed for Excommunication. And it is here twice repeated, <hi>(The Lord rebuke thee, even the Lord rebuke thee)</hi> not only to ſhow the fulneſſe of Satans rebuke; but to ſhow the fulneſſe of the interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt. Now would we ſee the fulneſſe of Chriſts apology for <hi>Joſhua?</hi> Saies the Lord unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, even the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke thee: And (ſaies he at the latter end of the 2. verſe) <hi>Is not this a brand pluck't out of the fire?</hi> Thus; it is true Lord, that <hi>Joſhua</hi> hath filthy garments: but yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>Joſhua</hi> is but as a brand pluck't newly out of the burning. Take a brand, and pull it newly out of the fire, and there will be duſt, aſhes, and dirt about it. Lord (ſaies he) <hi>Joſhua</hi> is but newly puld out of the burning, and therefore, Lord, he muſt needs have ſome aſhes, and ſome
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:162405:28"/>dirt, and ſome filth about him: O Lord, (ſaies Chriſt) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that <hi>Joſhua</hi> be clothed with filthy garments, I will take away thoſe filthy garments: verſe the 4. <hi>He anſwered and ſpake unto thoſe that ſtood before him ſaying, Take away the filthy garments from him: and unto him he ſaid, Behold, I have cauſed thine iniquity to paſſe from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.</hi> This can be none but Chriſt. Thus Chriſt takes off the accuſation that was brought againſt <hi>Joſhua</hi> by <hi>Satan,</hi> for his filthy garments. And ſo does the Lord Chriſt now: If a poor ſoul fall into any ſin, defile his garments: Satan, he comes in, and takes the right hand of him, ſtands at the right hand and accuſes, by reaſon of this filthy garment: but our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, our great High-Prieſt, he being at the right hand of the Father, takes up the cauſe, and anſwers to the accuſation: True Lord, this poor ſoul, indeed hath filthy garments; but he is but as a fire-brand pluck't newly out of the burning: He was in his natural, and ſinful condition the other day, in his burning, and he is but newly changed, and therefore he muſt needs have ſome dirt, and ſome filth upon him, as a fire-brand pluck't out of the burning; and therefore conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him in that reſpect, and though he have filthy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments now upon him; yet I will give him change of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and take away his filthy garments. Thus the Lord Chriſt ſteps in to God the Father, and anſwers to all thoſe accuſations that are brought againſt him to God the Father. This is the Third thing that he does by way of his Interceſſion.</p>
               <p>Again, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>4</label> He doth not only plead our Cauſe, and take off accuſations that are brought againſt us: But he does alſo, call for Abſolution, and for Pardon of poor ſinners, at the hand of God the Father, in a way of juſtice and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: And therefore he is called,<note place="margin">1 <hi>John,</hi> 2.1.</note> 
                  <hi>our Advocate: If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi> The work of an Advocate, differs from the work of a Petitioner: an Advocate does not Petition the Judge, but an Advocate, he tels the Judge what is Law,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:162405:28"/>what is right, &amp; what ought to be done. So the Lord Jeſus Chriſt being in Heaven, and making Interceſſion, is there as our Advocate: Lord (ſaies he) this man he hath ſinned indeed, but I have ſatisfyed for his ſins, I have paid for them to the full, I have ſatisfied thy wrath to the ful: now therefore, in a way of Equity, and in a way of Juſtice, I do here call for this mans pardon: Thus Chriſt intercedes. And thus we ſee (briefly) wherein the Interceſſion of Chriſt conſiſteth, and what he does when we ſay, That he Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes for us in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Well, But ſuppoſe he does Intercede, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> Can he prevaile in his Interceſſion, hath he any potency, power, or preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency with God the Father in his Interceſſion?</p>
               <p>Yes very much: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> and therefore we find in that ſame 3. of <hi>Zach.</hi> That <hi>Joſhua</hi> goes away with a faire Myter upon his head: ver. 5. <hi>And I ſaid, let them ſet a faire Myter (or a Crown) upon his head: ſo they ſet a faire Myter (or a Crown) upon his head, and clothed him with garments, and the Angel of the Lord ſtood by.</hi> Satan (at the beginning) ſtood at his right hand to accuſe him: but this Accuſer of the brethren goes away with a double rebuke, and <hi>Joſhua</hi> goes away with a Crown, through the Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt he goes away with a Crown upon his head.</p>
               <p>All which will appear to you, if we conſider Three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> What great intereſt our Lord and Saviour Chriſt hath in the boſome of God the Father. <hi>Paul</hi> prevailed with <hi>Philemon</hi> for <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> through the great intereſt that <hi>Paul</hi> had in the boſome of <hi>Philemon.</hi> Our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, he hath lien in the boſome of God the Father from all eternity: he is his Son, his natural Son, his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son, his Son that did never offend him: and therefore ſurely when he comes, and intercedes for a man, he is moſt like to ſpeed, to prevaile. We know, that <hi>David</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out againſt <hi>Nabal</hi> and his houſe; <hi>Abigail</hi> comes forth, meets with <hi>David,</hi> and intercedes for <hi>Nabal:</hi> and <hi>Abigail</hi> did ſo powerfully intercede, even for <hi>Nabal,</hi> that ſhe turned
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:162405:29"/>
                  <hi>Davids</hi> heart quite round about. <hi>David</hi> ſwore he would not leave one of the houſe, and after <hi>Abigail</hi> had interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a little for <hi>Nabal,</hi> in the 1 of <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.32. verſe, <hi>David</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Abigail, Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, which ſent thee this day to meet me: and bleſſed be thy advice, and bleſſed be thou which haſt kept we this day from coming to ſhod blood.</hi> Pray, what did <hi>Abigail</hi> ſay, that ſhee turned <hi>David</hi> thus about, that her interceſſion was thus powerful? Saies <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gail,</hi> as for <hi>Nabal,</hi> he is according to his name. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs</hi> (at the 30. verſe) <hi>when the Lord ſhall have done to my Lord, according to all the good that he hath ſpoken concerning thee, and ſhall have appointed thee ruler over Iſrael, that this ſhall be no griefe unto thee, nor offence of heart to my Lord, either that thou haſt ſhed blood cauſeleſſe, or that my Lord hath avenged himſelfe.</hi> This ſhal be no griefe at all unto thine heart (ſaies ſhe) and other words that ſhe uſed; by which ſhe prevailed here with <hi>David.</hi> But <hi>Abigail</hi> was a ſtranger to <hi>David:</hi> and <hi>Abigail</hi> ſhe prayes, and intercedes for <hi>Nabal,</hi> a wicked, vile, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh man. Shall <hi>Abigail,</hi> a woman, a ſtranger prevail thus with <hi>David</hi> for a <hi>Nabal?</hi> and ſhall not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of the Father, not a ſtranger, nor a ſtranger to his boſome, but beloved from everlaſting, ſhall not be prevaile much more, when he comes, and pleads the cauſe of the Elect, and of the Children of God, in the preſence of God the Father, whom the Father loves alſo? Great is the Rhetorick of a Child: if a Child do but cry, Father, eſpecially if the child be a wiſe child, he may prevail much with a tender hearted father. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he is the Son of the Father, and he is the Wiſdom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too; and God the Father is a tender hearted father: Oh! ſurely therefore, Powerful are the Interceſſions of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt with God the Father.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The prevalency of Chriſts Interceſſions with the Father, will appear: if we conſider, The inclination, and diſpoſition, that God the Father hath, unto the ſame things that Chriſt prayeth, and intercedeth for. If a child ſhould come, and intreat his father, in a matter that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:162405:29"/>the father hath no mind to, or that the father is ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt; poſſibly he might not prevail: But if a beloved child ſhall come and pray the father, in a buſineſs that the father likes as well as the child; ſurely then, the child is very like to ſpeed. Thus it is: The Lord Jeſus Chriſt comes, and he intercedes for us: and the Father hath as great an inclination, and diſpoſition unto the work that Chriſt intercedes for, as Chriſt himſelf hath: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaies Chriſt, <hi>Loe, I come to do thy will: I come not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi> That which Chriſt did, that he had a mind to, it was rather, the will of the Father, than Chriſts will: the Father is as ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, and diſpoſed to what Chriſt did, and wils, as Chriſt himſelf. <hi>Thoſe that thou haſt given me</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>I have loſt none:</hi> they are thine own, Lord, and therefore I pray for them. We have a notable expreſſion to this end, in the 10. Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> and the 17. verſe. <hi>Therefore doth my father love me, becauſe I lay down my life, that I may take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. I lay down my life:</hi> Here's his ſuffering, and his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. <hi>That I may take it again:</hi> Go up to Heaven, and take it again and intercede. <hi>Therefore doth my father love me.</hi> Oh! what a round of love is here: God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of love, ſends Chriſt into the world to die for man: <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.</hi> Wel, Jeſus Chriſt out of love to us, he dies for us: Who hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, and given himſelf for us. The Father loves the world in giving Chriſt, The Son loves the world in dying for us; and the Father, he loves Chriſt again, for loving us: Chriſt loves us, and the Father loves Chriſt again for loving of us: a mighty high expreſſion, That the Father ſhould love Chriſt, for loving us. So then look wherein the love of Chriſt is ſeen unto poor ſinners, the Fathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and diſpoſition is untot hat as much as Chriſts: So that when he comes unto God the Father, and does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede, he muſt needs prevail, becauſe the Father loves him for his interceding, the Father likes the matter as well as he, loves you the better for it.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:162405:30"/>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> This will appear alſo, if we conſider, upon what termes our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, our great High-Prieſt, was taken, and admitted into Heaven, the Holy of Holieſt: ſo it is called. He was Honourably received into Heaven, and he ws received thither, for to do the work of the High-Prieſt. He was Honourably received when he came to Heaven: <hi>Sit thou down at my right hand</hi> (ſaies God the Father to him) a note of Honour. When <hi>Solomon</hi> would expreſſe his Honour to his mother, he ſet her down at his right hand. Thus God the Father would expreſſe the Honourable welcome that Chriſt had when he came to Heaven: Sit thou down on my right hand (ſaies he.) Now ye ſhall obſerve, that when ſoever this is made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, The ſitting down at the right hand of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it is made mention of, not with the Kingly Office of Chriſt, but with the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt: as if that he were ſet down there, to do the work of the Prieſtly Office: One would think (I ſay) that this ſhould be expreſt with the Kingly Office of Chriſt: but you ſhall find it running along in the Scripture, ſtill with the Prieſtly Office of Jeſus Chriſt. Look into the 8. Chapter of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the 1. verſe. Now of the things which we have ſpoken, this is the ſum: <hi>We have ſuch an High-Prieſt, who is ſet on the right hand of the Throne, of the Majeſty in the Heavens.</hi> It's named with the Prieſtly Office. And ſo again, in the 10. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> at the 11. and 12. verſes. <hi>Every High-Prieſt ſtandeth dayly miniſtring, and offering often times the ſame ſacrifices, which can never take away ſin: But this man,</hi> (ſpeaking of Chriſt) <hi>after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſins for ever, ſate down on the right hand of God:</hi> It is carried a long with the mention of the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt: as if he were ſate down on the right hand of God the Father in Heaven, on purpoſe to do the work of the Prieſtly Office. When Jeſus Chriſt came into Heaven, into the Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt, he came thither as our great High-Prieſt; and he ſaid unto God the Father; Lord, I am not now come in mine own name, for my own ſake only, but I come as the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:162405:30"/>great High-Prieſt, having on this Breſt-plate, the name of all the Elect; and I come to intercede for poor ſinners; I come as High-Prieſt: Saies God the Father to him, Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come upon thoſe termes, welcome upon thoſe termes, not wich ſtanding thou doeſt come in their names, come and ſit down at my right hand, ſaies God the Father to him: Thus Father is ingaged, for he received him upon thoſe termes into Heaven, as our great High-Prieſt; the Father therefore is engaged to hear his Interceſſion, and ſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Jeſus-Chriſt, muſt have a great deal of power, and prevalency with God the Father in Heaven. This is the Second thing.</p>
               <p>But, Thirdly, <hi>Does the Lord Jeſus Chriſt intercede for us in Heaven, as our great High-Prieſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes, and he does do this, in a more tranſcendent, and eminent way and manner, than ever any High-Prieſt did before Him.</p>
               <p>For Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> He hath gone through more Temptations than ever any High-Prieſt did. <hi>He was tempted</hi> (ſaies the text) <hi>that he might ſuccour thoſe that are temped, as an High-Prieſt:</hi> If he was Tempted, that he might ſuccour thoſe that are Tempted; ſuccour them as an High-Prieſt, then the more he was Tempted, the more experimentally able he is for to ſuccour thoſe that are Tempted. Never any High-Prieſt, that was Tempted like unto Chriſt. <hi>He was</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>in all things tempted, like unto us, ſin only excepted.</hi> Poor ſoul, name any temptation, that thy heart is ſcared at the thoughts of, and you will find, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he was tempted with that temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. You will ſay, I am often times tempted to doubt Whether I be the Child of God or no, and that very often. So was Chriſt too: you know the place in the 4. of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew: If thou be the Son of God; and if thou be the Son of God,</hi> twice that the Devil would ſet an <hi>If</hi> upon Chriſts Son-ſhip. Oh! but I am tempted often times to uſe indirect means to get out of trouble. So was Chriſt too: <hi>Command that theſe ſtones be made bread,</hi> ſaies the Devil to him. Oh! but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:162405:31"/>ſometimes I have been tempted, even to lay violent hands upon my ſelf. So did the Devil tempt Chriſt too; <hi>Caſt thy ſelf down off the pinacle of the Temple;</hi> that was a temptation. Oh! but I am tempted unto ſuch evil things, that truely I am afraid to ſpeak of, ſuch Blaſphemies, ſuch horrid, and wretched Blaſphemies, as I think never came upon the heart of any child of God, ſo that I am afraid to think of them, and aſhamed to mention them. And was not Chriſt ſo? was not he tempted ſo? Saies the Devil to him, <hi>All this will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> Oh! horrid Blaſphemy! Bluſh, bluſh, O Sun: that the Lord Jeſus, the God of glory, ſhould fall down to the Devil, and worſhip the Devil; what wretched blaſphemy was here, that he ſhould ſpeak this? and yet the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he was tempted to it. What ſhall I ſay, He was in all things tempted like unto us, ſin only excepted. Now, there was never any High-Prieſt that was ſo tempted, and he was therefore tempted, that he might ſuccour thoſe that are tempted. He is more able as our High-Prieſt to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, to put in for you, and to ſuccour you, than ever any High-Prieſt was before him.</p>
               <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As he hath gone through more Temptations than ever any High-Prieſt did: So alſo, he is filled with more Compaſſions. It behoved the High-Prieſt to be Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful: it is an office of love, and Mercy. Now our Lord and Saviour Chriſt (ſaies the Apoſtle) is ſuch an High-Prieſt, as cannot but be touched with your infirmities: the High-Prieſt that did go before him, ſometimes, was not touched with their infirmities: <hi>Hannah</hi> came and prayed, and <hi>Eli's</hi> heart was not touched with her infirmity, at the firſt. But our High-Prieſt cannot but be touched, he does ſympathize with us under all our infirmities. He is affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in all our afflictions. It was the work of the High-Prieſt to ſympathize with the people; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, there was a law, that the High-Prieſt might not mourn for his kindred, in that he might not, as others, ſympathize, or mourn. But now, our Lord Jeſus, he does
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:162405:31"/>fully ſympathize with us, and therefore goes beyond all the High-Prieſts that ever was before him.</p>
               <p>Further, He is more faithful in his office, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and place than ever any High-Prieſt was. <hi>Aaron</hi> was an High-Prieſt, butunfaithful in the matter of the golden calfe. But our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, he is more faithful than <hi>Moſes</hi> was, In this 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. verſes, (and ſo on.) <hi>Wherefore ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brethren, conſider the Apoſtle and High-Prieſt of our profeſſion Chriſt Jeſus, who was faithful to him that appointed him, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> Moſes <hi>was faithful in all his houſe.</hi> He ſteps over <hi>Aaron,</hi> who was the the High-Prieſt, and he compares him here to <hi>Moſes</hi> in faithfulneſs. Now <hi>Moſes</hi> was faithful in all his houſe: But our Lord and Saviour here, he is preferred before <hi>Moſes</hi> in point of faithfulneſs; yet it is ſaid, Moſes <hi>was faithful in all his houſe.</hi> When that the Lord comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Moſes</hi> any thing, as the Lord commanded ſo did he, and roſe up early in the morning to do the commandement of God: He was faithful in all his houſe; and yet our Lord and Saviour was more faithful than <hi>Moſes</hi> in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Prieſthood. For ſo it is brought in here, at the 3. verſe. <hi>For this man was counted worthy of more glory than</hi> Moſes, <hi>in as much as be who hath builded the houſe, hath more honour than the houſe.</hi> Verſe the 5. Moſes <hi>verily was faithful in all his houſe, as a ſervant, for a teſtimony of thoſe things which were to be ſpoken after; but Chriſt as a Son over his own houſe.</hi> Look now, as a Child, or a ſon is more faithful in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe than a ſervant will be: ſo, (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>Chriſt</hi> is more faithful than <hi>Moſes.</hi> And look as the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the houſe, does go beyond, and excel every beam, and ſtone in the houſe, or every part of the building: So does the Lord Chriſt in faithfulneſs, exceed <hi>Moſes.</hi> You will ſay, there is a great difference between a ſtone in the building, and the maker of the houſe: Look what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is between a ſtone, or a piece of wood, &amp; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the building! ſo great a difference there is (ſaies the Apoſtle) between Jeſus Chriſt, in the matter of his <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> and <hi>Moſes;</hi> yet notwithſtanding, <hi>Moſes</hi> is faithful in all his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:162405:32"/>houſe. Oh! then, how faithful is Jeſus Chriſt, in the matter of his Prieſthood! He goes before all that ever went before him.</p>
               <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Take other High-Prieſts, and though they were never ſo good, they could not alwaies intercede, they died; the High-Prieſt died, and another came in his room: But this man liveth for ever to make Interceſſion.</p>
               <p>Yea, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Take the High-prieſt in the times of the old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and while he lived, he did not alwaies intercede for the people: Once in a year, the High-prieſt came to enter into the Holy of Holieſt to ſprinkle the Mercy-ſeat with blood, and cauſed a cloud to ariſe upon the Mercy-ſeat, with his prayers, and interceſſions for their acceptance: and then he went out of the Holy of Holieſt, and laid aſide his garments. But now, our great High-prieſt, is aſcended into the Holy of Holieſt never to put off his Prieſtly gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and he does not once a year ſprinkle the Mercy-ſeat with his ſacrifice, but every day: and therefore he goes beyond all the High-prieſts that ever went before him.</p>
               <p>And yet further: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Take the High-prieſt in the old Law, in the times of the old Teſtament: and though they did offer ſacrifice for ſome ſinnes, and intercede; yet there was other ſins again, that no ſacrifice was to be offered for. If a man did kill another at un-awares, there was a ſacrifice. If a man ſinned ignorantly, there was a ſacrifice. But ſaies the Text in the 15. of <hi>Numbers,</hi> 30. verſ. <hi>If any man ſin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly, he ſhall be cut off, and there ſhall be no ſacrifice for him:</hi> No ſacrifice, no interceſſion by the High-prieſt then. But we have ſuch an High-prieſt, that makes interceſſions for <hi>All</hi> ſins.

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>To our Comfort.</hi> Very much to our Comfort. And therefore in the 1. Chap. of <hi>Zach.</hi> good words, &amp; comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are ſpoken upon this occaſion: (ver. 8.) ſaies the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>I ſaw by night, and behold, a man riding upon a red horſe, and he ſtood among the myrile-trees that were in the bottome, and behind him were there red horſes ſpeckled &amp; white. Then ſaid I, O my Lord, what are theſe? And the Angel that talked with me, ſaid unto me, I will ſhew thee what theſe be. And the man that ſtood among the myrtle-trees, anſwered and ſaid, Theſe are they, whom the Lord hath ſent to walke to and fro through the earth. And they anſwered the Angel of the Lord that ſtood among the myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-trees, and ſaid, Wee have walked to and fro through the earth, and behold, all the earth ſitteth ſtill, and is at reſt. And the Angel of the Lord anſwered, and ſaid, O Lord of hoſts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jeruſalem, and on the Cities of Judah, againſt which thou haſt had indignation theſe threeſcore and ten years?</hi> Here is Interceſſion. <hi>And the Lord anſwered the Angel that talked with me, with good words, and comfortable words.</hi> Give me leave to open the words a little, and we ſhall ſee how much it makes to our comfort, this Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Jeſus Chriſt. At the 8. verſe, <hi>I ſaw</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>a man riding upon a red horſe.</hi> This is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thus unto us. <hi>And he ſtood among the myrtle-trees.</hi> The Saints and people of God, they are called myrtle-trees, for their greenneſs, ſweetneſs, and fruitfulneſs. <hi>And theſe myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-trees were in the bottome.</hi> That is, in a dark, in a low, and a poor condition: it is the condition of myrtle-trees, and of the Saints and people of God to be oft in bottoms, and in a dark and low condition. Well: <hi>Behind him were there red horſes, ſpeckled, and white: And I ſaid, O my Lord, what are theſe?</hi> Now that this is Chriſt; Firſt of all, he is called a Man, and an Angel too. Secondly, As Chriſt walked between the golden Candleſticks, in the book of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:</hi> So here he ſtood among the mirtle-trees, among the Saints. And behind him (attending upon him) were red
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:162405:33"/>horſes, ſpeckled and white. That is, Angels ſent to and fro through the earth, upon his meſſage, and upon his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand; and unto him they come and give an account, and to none but Chriſt. Then we ſhall ſee this Angel, that ſtood among the myrtle-trees, comes and Intercedes: all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels they come and bring in this report, That the Church and people of God were in a low condition. <hi>Then this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel that ſtood among the Myrtle-trees, anſwered and ſaid,</hi> (at the 12. verſe) <hi>O Lord of hoſts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jeruſalem, and on the Cities of Judah, againſt which thou haſt had indignation theſe threeſcore and ten yeers?</hi> It muſt needs be Chriſt, for no Angel intercedes, but Chriſt alone. What is the fruit of this Interceſſion? (at the 13. verſe) <hi>The Lord anſwered the Angel that talked with me, with good words, and comfortable words.</hi> I (indeed) good words, and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are the fruit of the Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt. It is a matter of great comfort this, That the Lord Chriſt, our great High-Prieſt, is in Heaven to intercede for us. Is it not a comfort to a poor man, to have a friend above, neer the King, or in the Court, that may be able to do him kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? A man ſometimes ſaies, I had a friend indeed in the Court, but now he is dead. I but, here is a friend that never dies: He ever lives to make Interceſſion. Friends may alter, and turn enemies; but he changeth not. Our Lord and Saviour Chriſt ſaid unto his Diſciples, Rejoyce not in this, that the Devils fall down like lightning before you: but rejoyce in this, <hi>That your names are written in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> it is a matter of great joy to have ones name written in Heaven: Oh! but what is it then, to have ones name written in the chiefe part of Heaven, to have ones name written there, upon the breaſt-plate of Jeſus Chriſt, our great High-Prieſt, that is gone into the Holy of Holieſt. Thus it is, The Lord Chriſt is now gone to Heaven, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Holy of Holieſt, and carries our names into the preſence of God the Father, and there pleades, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes for us. Oh! what matter of comfot is here!</p>
               <p>But you will ſay unto me: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>This is indeed exceeding
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:162405:33"/>good, and very comfortable in it ſelf: but what is this to me? for I am afraid that the Lord Chriſt, does not intercede for me: if indeed I could perſwade my ſelf, that the Lord Jeſus were in Heaven as my High-Prieſt, to intercede for me, I think verily I ſhould have comfort, though I were in the loweſt bottom, though I were in Hell it ſelf: but Oh! I am afraid to bear my ſelf upon the Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, leſt I ſhould preſume.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the great Objection, and ſtands up continually, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
                  </label> to reſiſt the comforts of Gods people: Give me leave there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to deal with this Objection all along, and to take it off, that ſo the comfort may fall the more fully upon you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I will ſhew, It is no preſumption for us, to bear our ſelves upon the Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Who thoſe are, that the Lord Chriſt does Intercede for in Heaven.</p>
               <p>And Thirdly, How willing, how infinitely willing he is to Intercede for us: that ſo I may bring the comfort neerer to our own boſomes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I ſay it is no Preſumption for us to bear our ſelves upon the Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt: no Preſumption to beleeve. We know the ſtory of the woman in the Goſpel, that came unto our Lord and Saviour, touching the hem of his garment for her cure, and ſhe was cured thereby. But our Saviour perceiving vertue to be gone from him, he cals out the perſon, <hi>Who hath touched me? come forth;</hi> and the woman came forth trembling. Our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, does not ſay to this poor woman, How dare you thus touch me? how durſt you thus preſume to do it? Conſider, The woman had no Command to do it, no Precept to back her: The woman had no promiſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage her; that if ſhee did touch the hem of his garment, ſhe ſhould be cured. The woman had no Example; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any before that touched the hem of his garment and was cured: No Commandement, No Promiſe, No Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Surely now, if any woman, or man, ſhould Preſume, it ſhould be this woman, that had no Commandement,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:162405:34"/>nor no Promiſe, nor no Example; and yet the Lord Jeſus Chriſt does not chide her away, does not tell her, ſhe had preſumed; but, <hi>O woman thy faith hath ſaved thee, thy faith hath made the whole.</hi> Let me ſpeake this home, we have a Command now to beleeve in Chriſt; and a Promiſe: Thoſe that come unto him, he ever liveth to make Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for them: And we have Examples of many that have come unto Jeſus Chriſt, born themſelves upon his Interceſſion, and have gone away cured: what! was it no Preſumption for the woman to come and touch Chriſt, without a Commandement, and a Promiſe, and an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? and have you Examples, and have you Promiſes, and have you Commandements to beleeve, and will you ſay this is Preſumption? Be not deceived, it is no Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for thee, poor ſoul, to bear thy ſelf at length upon Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> To make this out a little more fully: I ſhall diſcover who thoſe are that the Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt does belong unto.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1</note> 
                  <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi> You will ſay, This is to be carried upon thoſe that were ſpoke of before: and thoſe were ſuch as had fellowſhip with the Father: <hi>Truely, our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> Chap. 1. verſe 3. <hi>Now if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi> If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man that hath fellowſhip with the Father, or Chriſt, ſin; they have an Advocate with God the Father. Firſt therefore ſtand you by I pray, that we will take for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, all you that ever had any fellowſhip with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or with Jeſus Chriſt; this Doctrine of the Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus Chriſt, and the comfort hereof does belong to you.</p>
               <p>Moreover, In the 17. Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> there we find, that our Saviour ſaies, He prayes for thoſe that do beleeve, and ſhould beleeve. Thoſe that he prayes for here, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes for in Heaven: <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone</hi> (at the 20. verſe) <hi>but for them alſo which ſhall beleeve on me through thy
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:162405:34"/>word.</hi> I do not pray only for thoſe that do beleeve now, but for them alſo which ſhall beleeve. Well then, here is a ſecond ſort, Thoſe that do beleeve, and thoſe that wait upon the Lord in the Ordinance, that they may beleeve, or ſhall beleeve; Stand you by alſo, you are another ſort of people, that the Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thereof does belong unto.</p>
               <p>But now yet further, If we look into the 7. Chapter of this Epiſtle unto the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> at the 25. verſe, we ſhall find theſe words: <hi>Wherefore, he is able alſo, to ſave them to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for them.</hi> Who are thoſe? Thoſe that come unto God by him. Lay this, and 53. Chapter of <hi>I ſaiah</hi> the 12. verſe together. <hi>He was numbred with the tranſgreſſors</hi> (ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Chriſt cleerly) <hi>and he bare the ſins of many, and made interceſſion for the tranſgreſſors.</hi> It may be thou canſt not ſay, I have fellowſhip with God the Father: it may be thou canſt not ſay, I do beleeve, I am perſwaded that I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; thou canſt not ſay ſo: Well, but can you ſay thus: Through the Lords grace, I do come unto God by Chriſt; I have been, and I am a great tranſgreſſor, but I come unto God by Chriſt; I am one of the coming-tranſgreſſors: I have been a tranſgreſſor, but I am a coming-tranſgreſſor, I come unto God by Chriſt. Stand you by alſo, this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it belongs unto you: And let me tell thee for thy comfort (poor ſoul) whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou haſt been, that comeſt unto the Lord by Chriſt, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, our great High-Prieſt, he is gone to Heaven to intercede for thy ſoul.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> 
                  <hi>There is one thing that makes me afraid he will not intercede for me, I have been ſo great a tranſgreſſor: for I have been a tranſgreſſor againſt Jeſus Chriſt, this High-Prieſt: Oh! I have ſinned againſt this great High-Prieſt, Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore I am afraid he will not intercede for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For anſwer to this, I ſhall only deſire you to turn to the 16. Chapter of <hi>Numbers,</hi> the 41. verſe, and conſider it duely; <label type="milestone">

                  </label> we reade there, that all the Congregation murmured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:162405:35"/>
                  <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron: Aaron</hi> was the High-Prieſt: <hi>And</hi> (ſaies the text) <hi>all the Congregation of the children of Iſrael mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured againſt</hi> Moſes, <hi>and againſt</hi> Aaron, <hi>ſaying, Ye have killed the people of the Lord.</hi> They had murmured againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> Then (at the 46. verſe) Moſes <hi>ſaid unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>Take a Cenſer, put fire therein from off the Altar, put on incenſe, go quickly unto the Congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the Lord, the plague is begun.</hi> And ſee what <hi>Aaron</hi> did: <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>took as</hi> Moſes <hi>comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ran into the midſt of the Congregation, and behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incenſe, and made an atonement for the people.

Oh! if there was ſo much bowels, and compaſſions in the Type, in <hi>Aaron,</hi> when they had ſinned againſt him, as to go and intercede for them: How much more is there in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Typified High-Prieſt, to poor ſouls, to intercede for them.</p>
               <p>But now, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> this may be more fully made out to us, if we do but take in the Third thing, and that is: <hi>The Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, he is infinitely willing to intercede for us.</hi> We have ſeen who thoſe are unto whom the Interceſſion of Chriſt belongs: namely, Such as have had any fellowſhip with God the Father, or with Chriſt: Such as do beleeve, or ſhall hereafter beleeve: And all thoſe poor tranſgreſſors that come unto God the Father by Chriſt. Now obſerve, how infinitely willing the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is to intercede for us that are thus: That will appear thus:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                  <hi>He muſt needs be willing to do that which he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his anointing for.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that he was anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and that ointment ran down upon his beard, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the skirts of all his garment: not a piece of <hi>Aarons</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but was perfumed with the ointment that <hi>Aaron</hi> was
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:162405:35"/>anointed with. Surely, there is not a skirt of the garment of Jeſus Chriſt, but the anointment wherewithal He, our High-Prieſt was anointed, does run down upon him. He is the Meſſiah, the anointment: So he is called in the 10. of <hi>Iſaiah. The anointment. He was anointed with the oyle of gladneſs above all his fellows:</hi> above all the High-Prieſts that ever were before him. And he was anointed for this very end, That he might do the work of the High-Prieſt; which is, to Intercede for the ſins of the people. And therefore in that place in <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt ſignifies A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed. If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father: But who is that? He is <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that ſignifies <hi>your Saviour,</hi> and ſo he is willing to intercede. I but, it may be he is not able to do it, it may be he hath not received the anointing to do it. Yes, He is called Chriſt. If any man ſin, we have an <hi>Advocate</hi> with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt: or if you will, <hi>Saviour, Anointing.</hi> So that he is anointed for this end and purpoſe, to be your Advocate. Now if a man do receive money for to lay out for the benefit of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, poor Orphans, or the like: if a man be faithful, certainly, he will lay out the money for them, according to the intention of him that did truſt him with the money. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he hath received the Anointing, he is anointed as our great High-Prieſt, to do the work of the Prieſtly Office: and this is one work, to Intercede, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt needs be very willing to do it.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>The more any thing is the work of a mans Relation,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>wherewithal he is clothed, the more</hi> (if he be faithful) <hi>is he willing to do the work.</hi> And I pray mind it a little. When men are exalted, and come to Greatneſſe, or Honor, then they give down the comforts of their Relation unto thoſe that depend upon them: If a father come to any great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; the comfort of the Relation of a father, then fals down upon the children, runs down then upon the fruit of his loynes. And ſo, if one friend do come unto prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the comfort of the Relation, (or friendſhip) fals
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:162405:36"/>down. Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he is our High-Prieſt; and he is now exalted, he is gone to Heaven: and therefore all the comforts of all the Relations that he ſtands in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, do now fall upon us. And therefore, he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, he is very willing, becauſe this is the work of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>And further, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>It is the work of his Office.</hi> What a man does by office, that he does willingly; what a man does by office, he does induſtriouſly, he does not do it by the bye: what a man does by office, he does it readily; according unto a mans place, or office, ſo will his interpretation be. Suppoſe now a Child that hath very good parts, come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore three men, of three ſeveral profeſſions; A Lawyer, a Miniſter, and a Merchant. The Child having very good parts; the Merchant ſaies, He will make a very good Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant: the Lawyer ſaies, He will make a very good Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer: and the Miniſter ſaies, He wil make a very good Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: according to their three Relations, or Places, or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or work, their interpretation is. So now, if three men, of three ſeveral Trades, whoſe work lies about wood, come and behold a fine green-tree: One man ſaies, It is good for this: And another ſaies, It is good for that: and the third ſaies, It is good for another uſe: according to his Place, and Calling, will his interpretation be. So now, when a poor ſoul comes before God: <hi>Moſes</hi> (the Law) looks upon him: And the Devil looks upon him: And Jeſus Chriſt looks upon him: The work of the Law, is to Condemn; The work of the Devil, to Accuſe; And the work of Jeſus Chriſt, is to Intercede, it is the work of his office. Now therefore, aſſoon as the Devil ſees ſuch a ſoul, Oh (ſaies he) here's a fine inſtrument for me, here's a fit ſubject for me to injoy. Aſſoon as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſees this man, Here's a fine ſubject for me to condemne unto all Eternity. But when Jeſus Chriſt looks upon ſuch a ſoul, ſaies he, Heres a fine ſoul for me to ſave unto all Eternity, to intercede for: why? becauſe it is his Office, and what a man does by office, he interprets accordingly. Therefore what the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:162405:36"/>Lord Jeſus Chriſt does, he does by office, and he does it readily, and willingly. And I will give you one demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it; It was the end why Jeſus Chriſt was taken into Heaven, into the Holy of Holieſt; that he might In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede. According to the Scriptures mentioned before, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. <hi>For Chriſt is not entered into holy places made with hands, but into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us.</hi> He does not ſay thus, Chriſt is now gone to Heaven, to be glorified there; Chriſt is now gone to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to injoy the boſome of his Father, for his own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. No, but he is gone into Heaven to appear in the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God for us.</hi> This is the end of his aſcention. And ſo again in the 7. of the <hi>Hebrews, Wherefore, he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for us.</hi> What? is he in Heaven to be glorified there? No, but the end why Chriſt is in Heaven, <hi>Is to make interceſſion for poor ſinners:</hi> And therefore, he muſt needs be infinitly willing to do this, becauſe it is the end of his going thither, into the Holy of Holieſt. Oh therefore, be of good comfort, all you that do come unto God by him, for he is willing to intercede for you. And let not any thing diſcourage you: It may be you will complain, and ſay Oh! but I am much oppoſed here in this world. What matter, ſo long as Jeſus Chriſt does intercede for me in Heaven, and ſpeaks good words unto God the Father for me in heaven; what though I be oppoſed by men? It may be you will complain, and ſay, Oh! but I am much tempted, and cannot pray. Be humbled for it; but yet know this, That when you cannot pray, Chriſt prayes for you; and he prayes that you may pray. It may be you complain, and ſay, Oh! but I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under ſuch and ſuch corruptions, and the Devil he is buſie with me, exceeding buſie, and I cannot overcome them: and the Devil ſtands at my right hand for to tempt me, and to lead me into ſuch and ſuch ſins. Wel, be it ſo, yet notwithſtanding, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he is at the right hand of our Father, and he is ſet down at the right hand of God the Father, till all enemies be made his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:162405:37"/>and your ſins are his enemies: And therefore be of good comfort, O all ye people of the Lord. Is there ever a poor myrtle-tree, a ſoul that growes in a bottom, in a poor dark condition? be of good comfort, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, our great High-Prieſt, he is entered into Heaven, into the Holy of Holieſt, there to intercede with God the Father for thee.</p>

Me thinks a poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhould ſay, Indeed my ſins were ſo great, that I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid for to come unto God: But now I hear, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is in Heaven, to make interceſſion, for all thoſe that come unto God by him; Though I have been a Drunkerd, now I wil go unto God by Chriſt: And though I have been a Swearer, and though I have been an unclean wanton, yet I will go unto God by Chriſt. Indeed, I thought that my time was paſt; for I have been an Old Swearer; and I have been an Old Drunkard; and I have been an Old Sabbath-breaker; and I have been a ſinner ſo long, that I was even afraid of going to God at all; and thought there was no mercy, nor no pardon for me: But ſeeing now, that this is true, That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is in Heaven, to make interceſſion for all thoſe that come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God by him; Well, through the Lords grace, now I will go unto the Lord Chriſt, I will go unto Jeſus Chriſt: I indeed, am a young man, and I thought it was to no purpoſe to go unto God, God would not regard poor ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant ones, and I am a poor ignorant creature, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:162405:37"/>thought it was to no purpoſe for me to go unto God: But now I underſtand this, That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is in Heaven to make interceſſion for all thoſe that come unto God by him: Well then, Though I am ignorant, yet will I go unto God by Chriſt: and though I am but a poor young thing, and ſcarce underſtand the termes of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet will I go unto God by Chriſt. Oh! come unto Chriſt, come unto Chriſt: Behold here, in the Name of the Lord, I ſtand and make invitation to poor ſinners; Come poor Drunkard, Swearer, Sabbath-breaker, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean heart; the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is in Heaven to make interceſſion for all that come unto God by him; and will not you come? Oh! how will you anſwer it at the great day? when it ſhall be ſaid, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt made a tender, and offer of mercy to you, and you would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it, you would not come unto him. Here is matter of great Incouragment unto all poor ſinners to come unto Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again Secondly, <hi>The more I apprehend,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>or ſee with a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al eye, That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt does appear in Heaven for me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more am Fingaged to appear upon earth for him.</hi> (Mark I pray, that you may ſee how this does conduce unto Grace, and Holineſs.) Ah! ſhall the Lord Jeſus Chriſt appear in Heaven, before Saints, and Angels, and God the Father for my ſoul? and ſhal I be afraid to appear before poor worms for him? Shall the Lord Jeſus Chriſt own me in Heaven? and ſhall not I own him upon earth? Shall the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the great High-Prieſt, take my name, and carry it upon his breaſt into the preſence of God the Father? and ſhall not I take the Name of Chriſt, and hold it forth to the world? Oh! I beſeech you conſider, what a mighty ingagement is here, to ſtand to and appear for the Lord Chriſt, and to own his Cauſe in theſe backſliding times; becauſe he is now in Heaven appearing for you, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king interceſſion for you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The more I confider, or apprehend,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt does lay out himſelf for me, the more am I ingaged
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:162405:38"/>to lay out my ſelfe for him.</hi> The Scripture ſaies, <hi>He ever liveth to make interceſſion for you.</hi> He laies out his whole E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity for you. Me thinks we have here before us, the greateſt argument in the world for to make us to walke cloſely with God in Chriſt: For, ſhall the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſpend of his Eternity for me? and ſhall not I ſpend of my whole time for him? He Ever liveth: he Ever liveth to make interceſſion. Before the world was made, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light was in the habitable parts of the earth, among the children of men. He laid out himſelf in delighting upon you before the world was made. Well, in due time, he comes down into the world; and here while he was upon the earth, he laid out himſelf fully for you. Then he Dies, and goes up to Heaven, and (ſaies he) <hi>I go to prepare a place for you.</hi> He was at work for you, before the world began; Then he comes down upon the earth, and here he ſpends all his time for you: And now that he is gone to Heaven; the text ſaith, <hi>He ever liveth to make interceſſion for you:</hi> he ſpends off all his eternity for you. Oh! does not the Lord Jeſus grutch me Eternity, to ſpend off his Eternity for my ſoul? and ſhall I grutch the Lord Jeſus Chriſt a little time, to ſpend a little time for him? Surely, people don't think what Chriſt is doing in Heaven for them, (you that are Saints eſpecially) if you did, you could not be padling in the world ſo much. Shall the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in Heaven for me? and ſhall I be digging in the world? Shall he be making mention of my name unto God the Father, and interceding for me? and ſhall I be ſinning againſt him? ſhall I be contending with his children? ſhall I now be joyning with his Enemies? ſhall I be oppoſing his waies? Oh! if people would but think, what the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is doing in heaven for them, they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel ſo in the world againſt him as they do. Wherefore, that you may be kept from your ſins, &amp; kept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world, think of theſe things. The Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>Theſe things have I written unto ye, that ye ſin not: and if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi> And ſo
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:162405:38"/>ſay I to you, I have been here delivering to you this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, concerning the Prieſtly Office of Jeſus Chriſt: and theſe things have I preach't unto you, that you ſin not. And therefore, that you may be kept from ſin, and your hearts made more Holy; think of the Prieſtly Office of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, he is gone into Heaven to make interceſſion for you. And thus have I diſcovered the Second Particular of the Prieſtly Office of Jeſus Chriſt. A Third follows.</p>

               <p>Now if we inquire further, we ſhall find alſo, That the work of the High-Prieſt was, and now is, <hi>To offer up the gifts of the people unto God: To preſent our, Prayers, Praiſes, Duties, Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and all ſpiritual Performances unto God the Father, and to procure acceptance of him.</hi> This was done thus: In the times of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Tabernacle there were two Parts, or Courts; (as we reade in the 9. Chapter of the <hi>Hebrews</hi>) In the one, which was called, The Holy of Holieſt; there was the Arke, the Mercy-Seat, the Cherubims of glory, and the golden Cenſer. In the other, there was the Braſen-Altar, upon which they offered ſacrifices, there was the table of Shewbread, the golden Candleſtick, and the golden Altar, upon which incenſe was: This is expreſly laid down in the 2, 3, and 4. verſes of that 9. of <hi>Hebrews: For there was a taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:162405:39"/>made, the firſt wherein was the candleſtick and the table and the ſhew-bread; which is called the ſanctuary. And after the Second vail, the tabernacle which is called the holieſt of all, which had the golden cenſer, and the ark of the covenant, overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and</hi> Aarons <hi>rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it the cherubims of glory ſhadowing the Mercy-Seat.</hi> And as every day, morning and evening, there was a lamb offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, a ſacrifice for the ſins of the people, upon the Braſen-Alter; So every day, morning and evening, there was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe alſo, upon the golden-Altar: which was performed while the people were without at prayer, mingling that incenſe with their prayers; As it is in the 1. Chap. of <hi>Luke,</hi> the 8, 9, and 10. verſes. <hi>It came to paſſe that while he</hi> (that is, <hi>Zacharias</hi>) <hi>executed the Prieſts Office before God in the order of his courſe, according to the cuſiome of the Prieſts office, his lot was to burn incenſe when he went into the temple of the Lord: and the whole multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of incenſe.</hi> So that the incenſe, was at a time when they were ſweetly mingling their prayers and the incenſe together. But now, although that there was a ſacrifice every day, yet once in the yeer, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there was incenſe too, from the Golden Altar eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, yet once in the yeer, the High-Prieſt came, and he took the golden Cenſer, and putting incenſe into it from off the golden Altar, went into the Holy of Holieſt and cauſed a cloud of perfume to ariſe upon the Mercy-Seat. All which was a great Type of Jeſus Chriſt our High-Prieſt: who though he offered up himſelf a ſacrifice once for ſin without, yet when he died, and aſcended, he carried the vertue of that his blood into the Holy of Holieſt, into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſprinkled the Mercy-Seat therewith: Although he began to make Interceſſion while he lived, as we reade in the 17. of <hi>John;</hi> yet when he aſcended up into Heaven, the Holy of Holieſt, then he did take his golden Cenſer,

And this he does now as our High-Prieſt; for if we look into this book of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> we ſhall find, That the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the High Prieſt, relating unto Jeſus Chriſt; ſaies, in the 5. Chapter and the 1. verſe, That it was his work to offer Gifts: <hi>That he may offer both Gifts and ſacrifices.</hi> And ſo in the 8. Chapter and the 3. verſ. <hi>Every High-Priſt is ordained to offer Gifts and Sacrifices.</hi> Thus we have another great work, of our great High-Prieſt; which is, To offer up all our Prayers, our Duties, our Gifts unto God the Father: which if ye will, we may call another part of Chriſts Interceſſion; but I handle it diſtinct.</p>

                  <hi>He doth take our perſons, and carries them in unto God the Father, in a moſt unperceivable way to us.</hi> He knows, that if our Perſon be not firſt accepted, our Duty cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. Love me, and love my Duty; love me, &amp; love my Service: hate me, and hate my Service. In the Covenant
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:162405:41"/>of Works, God did firſt accept of the work, and then of the Perſon, the Perſon for the work: But in the Covenant of Grace, God doth firſt accept of the Perſon, and then the Work. Now therefore, that our Work, and our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be accepted with God the Father; The Lord Chriſt, our High-Prieſt, doth firſt take our Perſon, and our Name, and carries them into the preſence of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This was plainly ſhadowed out unto us, by that of the High-Preſt; Who went into the Holy of Holieſt, with the Names of all the Tribes upon his breaſt. Which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks out plainly:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12 <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>In whom we have acceſſe with boldneſs.</hi> The word <hi>Acceſſe,</hi> as ſome obſerve, is <hi>Manuducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Hand-leading:</hi> In whom we have an Hand-leading; or by whom we are led by the Hand, unto God the Father. As a child, having run away from his Father, is taken by the hand of a friend, or of his Elder brother, and brought again into the preſence of his father: So, all we having run away from God, are taken, and led again into the preſence of the Father by the hand of Jeſus Chriſt. He is that lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw, upon whom we do aſcend into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of God, and go into Heaven. Our High-Prieſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, doth firſt take our Perſons, and lead us into the preſence of God the Father. That is the firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>As he doth take our Perſons, and lead,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>and carry us into the preſence of God the Father: So, when we do perform any Duty, he doth obſerve what evil, or failing there is in that Duty, and draws it out, takes it away before he preſents the Duty-unto God the Father.</hi> A Child that would preſent his father with a Noſe-gay, or Poſie, goes into the garden, and he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers flowers, and weeds together; but coming to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhe takes them, and picks out the weeds, and binds up the flowers by themſelves, and ſo it is preſented to the father, Thus it is with us: We go to Duty, and we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weeds, &amp; flowers together: But the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he comes and picks out the weeds, and then he preſents no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but flowers unto God the Father.</p>
               <p>And this we have plainly ſet forth unto us, by that of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:162405:42"/>the High-Prieſt taking away the iniquities of the Holy things of Gods people, in the 28. Chapter of <hi>Exodus, Thou ſhalt make a plat-form of pure gold</hi> (at the 36. verſe) <hi>and grave upon it like the ingravings of a ſignet,</hi> HOLINES UNTO THE LORD. <hi>And thou ſhalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the Mytre; upon the forefront of the Mytre it ſhall be.</hi> Then at the 38. verſe, <hi>And it ſhall be on</hi> Aarons <hi>forehead</hi> (that is, the High-Prieſt) <hi>that</hi> Aaron <hi>may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the Children of Iſrael ſhall hallow in all their holy guifts: and it ſhall be alwaies upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the Lord.</hi> Thus taking away the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of their holy things. So it is ſaid concerning our Saviour Chriſt, in the 3. Chapter of <hi>Malachy,</hi> the 2, 3, &amp; 4. verſes, <hi>Who may abide the day of his coming?</hi> (plainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Chriſt, as appears by the firſt verſ.) Then at the 3. <hi>He ſhall ſit as a refiner, and purifier of ſilver; and he ſhall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the Sons of</hi> Levi, <hi>and purge them as gold and ſelver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteouſneſs. Then ſhall the offerings of Judah and Jeruſalem be pleaſant unto the Lord, as in the dayes of old.</hi> Then ſhall their offerings be pleaſant; When? when he hath purg'd their ſacrifices, and their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. This in the daies of his fleſh and now much more. This is the Second thing, that the Lord Chriſt, our great High-Prieſt doth in offering up our Gifts unto God the Father, He takes out the weeds.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>As he takes away the iniquity of our holy things; So he obſerves what good there is in any of our Duties, or Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances; and with that he mingles his own Prayers and Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; his own Intenſe; and preſents all as one work mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unto God the Father.</hi> This we have ſo fully in the 8. Chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that I need name no other place. <hi>Another Angel</hi> (at the 3. verſe) <hi>ſtood at the Altar, having a golden Cenſer, and there was given unto him much incenſe, that he ſhould offer it with the prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar, which was before the Throne. And the ſmoke</hi> (at the 4. verſe) <hi>of the incenſe which came with the prayers of the Saints, aſcended up before God, out of the Angels hand:</hi> This muſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:162405:42"/>needs be underſtood of Chriſt; for no Angel does inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede but Chriſt, who is called, <hi>The Angel of the Covenant.</hi> 'Tis ſaid here, He ſtood at the Altar, having a golden Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer: Which none of the High-Prieſts had: and there was given unto him much incenſe, and this he offered with the prayers of all the Saints; and the ſmoake of the incenſe came with the prayers of the Saints, and aſcended up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord. He alludes unto the way, and cuſtome of the Jewes, and the High-Prieſt: ſhewing, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth all this for us, as our great High-Prieſt: that is the meaning of it. So that this is plain what he doth, when as our great High-Prieſt, he offers up our Gifts unto God the Father.</p>
               <p>But in the Second place: <hi>Suppoſe he doth ſo, What Favour,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>2</label> 
                  <hi>or Acceptance hath this our great High-Prieſt in Heaven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He hath very much: <label type="milestone">

                  </label> 
                  <hi>Father</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>I thank thee that thou heareſt me alwaies.</hi> He never ſpake a word unto God the Father, but the father heard him alwaies. We reade (as I remember) but of Two places in the new Teſtament, where the Lord by an audible voice, gives teſtimony of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt his Son: And in both thoſe places, we have the ſame words uttered, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed:</hi> And again; <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> We may know what favour a man hath with another, by the Truſt that he doth commit to, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon him: <hi>Joſeph</hi> had great favour in the eyes of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> and how did it appear? It appear'd by this, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Pharaoh</hi> truſted him with ſo much. Now God the Father, hath truſted Jeſus Chriſt, this our great High-Prieſt, very much. This I ſhall evidence in Four Particulars, viz. <hi>What a great Truſt God the Father hath put upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It was an agreement between God the Father, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and Chriſt, the Second Perſon; before the world was, That in due time, he ſhould come into the world, take fleſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and die for ſinners: and he did ſo. But before Chriſt came into the world, there were thouſands of ſouls ſaved; How came they to be ſaved? They came to be ſaved
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:162405:43"/>by the blood of Chriſt, and before Chriſt had died. So then, God the Father ſaved them upon Chriſts bare word, That he would come into the world, and die for them. What a mighty Truſt was here? That ſo many hundred thouſand ſouls ſhould be ſaved, upon a bare word of Chriſt That he would come into the world, and die for them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>
               <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The Truſt appears in this: That he was made when he did come into the world, the great Lord-Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of all the Grace, and Comfort, that ſhould be given out unto the children of men. When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> truſted <hi>Joſeph,</hi> all the whole kingdom was put into his hand, with the Corn thereof, and not a grain was to be given out to any but as <hi>Joſeph</hi> gave it out: which argued a mighty Truſt. So now, That not any Grace, or Comfort, given out to the children of men, but only by the hand of Chriſt, it argues a mighty Truſt that the Father put upon him.</p>
               <p>But yet further, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> When our Lord and Saviour Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and aſcended unto God the Father to Heaven; as ſoon as ever he came into Heaven, ſaith the Father to him, <hi>Thou haſt now ſuffered, Aske of me, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:</hi> all the world at one word. Aske of me (ſaith he) and at the firſt word I will give thee the whole world. It was a mighty, and a great Truſt that the Father did put upon him.</p>
               <p>Yea, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> as if all this were not enough; The Father did put the keyes of Heaven, and of Hell into his hand: the keyes of Heaven and Hell into the hand of Chriſt. So we reade in the 1. of <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. ver. <hi>I am he that liveth, and was dead: and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keyes of Hell and of death.</hi> There's no man that goes to Hell, but he is lok't in by Jeſus Chriſt: And there's no man goes to Heaven, but Chriſt hath the keyes of Heaven, and he locks him in there unto all Eternity. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he hath the keyes of Hell, and of Heaven; he hath the keyes of all mens Eternities hanging at his girdle. Oh!
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:162405:43"/>what an infinite Truſt is here, that God the Father hath put upon him! Then let us conclude, if that Truſt do ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue favour; and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, our High-Prieſt, hath ſuch a great truſt as this put into his hands by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; what infinite Acceptance muſt he needs have with God the Father.</p>

And therefore, as Chriſt is called, The fulneſs of God the Father: So the Church is called, The fulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt: in the 1. of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and the laſt verſe; <hi>Which is his body, the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all.</hi> When our Lord and Saviour Chriſt came to die, and the heart and love of God the Father was let out unto him: Ye ſhall find, if ye look upon that 17. of <hi>John,</hi> and reade it all over, That he ſpends his time, not ſo much in praying for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: The time was but ſhort, and his prayer ſhort, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible let this cup paſſe: if not, yet not my will, but thine be done.</hi> But he ſpends moſt of the time, in praying, and interceding for thoſe that did beleeve, or ſhould afterward beleeve. The favour, and acceptance which the High-Prieſt had, in the times of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was not for himſelf: he had a Mitre upon his head, and a golden girdle upon his loynes, Prieſtly garments; and he had great acceptance when he went into the Holy of Holieſt; but it was not for himſelf, he did improve it all for the people: he was to lay it out all for the people, and not for himſelf. Our High-Prieſt, goes beyond all other High-Prieſts in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular alſo: for now, as for other High-Prieſts, though
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:162405:44"/>they went in with their incenſe, and covered the Mercy-ſeat with a cloud; yet it was but once in the yeer: But our High-Prieſt, is alwaies in the Holy of Holieſt, and never goes out of it, ever covering the Mercy-Seat with his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions. Take their High-Prieſt, and though he were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Holy, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was; yet ſometimes he made the people naked, unacceptable: But our great High-Prieſt, never makes his people naked, but alwaies clothes them with his own righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Take their High-Prieſt, and though he did go into the Holy of Holieſt for the people, yet he never led the people into the Holy of Holieſt, they ſtood without: But our great High-prieſt, is not only gone into the Holy of Holieſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but doth alſo lead every poor beleever into the Holy of Holieſt: as we reade in the 10. of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and the 19. verſe: <hi>Having therefore brethren boldneſs to enter into the Holieſt by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The people might not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Holieſt, in the time of the Jewes: But our great High-Prieſt, hath improved his favour for us thus far, that every man may come into the Holy of Holieſt.</p>
               <p>Now, If our great High-Prieſt in this reſpect, go beyond all the High-Prieſts that ever were before him, and they did improve their intereſt, and their favour, and their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance for the people, much more doth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, our High-Prieſt, improve the favour, intereſt, and acceptance that he hath in heaven, for our acceptance, and and the acceptance of all our Duties. And that is a Third Particular.</p>

Though the Sacrifice may be imperfect, yet your Obedience in offering the Sacrifice, may be perfect, with Goſpel-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. 'Tis in regard of our Duties, as in regard of our Perſons; never think that God will deal otherwiſe with our Duties, than he deals with our Perſons. The Lord
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:162405:46"/>came and juſtified the ungodly, when he juſtified you: He comes, and he finds a poor ſoul in a ſinful condition, &amp; he imputes his righteouſneſs unto that ſoul, and juſtifies an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly one, not juſtifying him ſo, as to go on in ſin; it is the word of the Apoſtle, <hi>He juſtifies the ungodly.</hi> So the Lord comes, and finds a great deal of ungodlineſs in your Duty, and he imputes his righteouſneſs unto that Duty; and he juſtifies the Duty, which in your eye is an ungodly duty. This indeed is the wonder of all, that he ſhould deal thus by us: For, did we ever hear of any garment, that would make the crooked ſtraight? If a man have a croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked back; come and put velvet upon him, ſilk, ſcarlet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, it may make him handſomer, but it will not change his back, and make him ſtrait. But when the Lord Chriſt comes, he finds all our ſouls crook-back't, as it were, and he puts on his righteouſneſs, and this garment makes that that was crooked to become ſtraite; it makes the very crook-back't Duty, to become a ſtrait Duty. Did we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hear, or reade, of any Seal, that when it was ſet upon the wax, would change the wax into gold, or into ſilver like the ſeal? it may leave it's impreſſion, but it does not change the wax into it's own mettall. If there be a ſtamp ſet upon ſilver, or gold, the mettal remains as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: But if a ſtamp be ſet upon braſſe, it don't make it ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; or if it be ſet upon ſilver, it don't make it gold. I but when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt comes unto a Duty, and ſets his own ſtamp, and his own righteouſneſs upon a Duty, that which was braſſe before; full of failings, and much unrighteouſneſs before, changes it into gold, into ſilver. He only hath the Philoſophers ſtone (as I may ſo ſpeak) all that Chriſt touches turns into gold; turns all our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties into gold: and when he hath done ſo, he preſents them unto God the Father. This our great High-Prieſt doth. And this is the Fourth thing.</p>

A man is unwilling to loſe any thing: and the more precious it is, the more unwilling to loſe it. If we have a venture at Sea; we are unwilling to loſe our ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and the greater our venture is, the more unwilling to loſe it. If a man have but a quarter of his Eſtate in a veſſel, he is unwilling to loſe it; more unwilling if he have half his Eſtate; moſt if he have all, and his children there in the veſſel too. Now as men are unwilling to loſe their worldly venture: So, a man that is ſenſible of his ſoul, is very unwilling to loſe his ſouls venture; to loſe his Prayers, and to loſe all his Duties. (Friends) here's an <hi>Inſuring-Office; The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is our great Inſurer in this reſpect:</hi> and he doth as he is our High-Prieſt, offering up our Gifts unto God the Father, aſſure us that none is loſt, not any loſt. Indeed, if we had ſuch an High-Prieſt, as were not able to take notice of the Circumſtances of our Duties, much might be loſt: but, this our Lord Chriſt, our great High-Prieſt, doth not only take notice of our Duty what ever it be; but of all the Circumſtances of our Duties, and ſo preſents them unto God the Father, in the full latitude, in all the gracious Circumſtances of them. Therefore ſaith he, unto the Angel of the Church of <hi>Pergamos</hi> in the 2. of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the 13. verſe; <hi>I know thy works.</hi> Why, but Lord, though thou doeſt know our works, yet it may be thou doeſt not take notice where our work is done: Lord, it may be thou doeſt take notice of my Prayer, but Lord, thou doeſt not take notice where I dwell, and live, and in what family I do pray unto thee; Lord, I am in a wicked, and a wretched family, that does oppoſe Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer: Lord, may be thou doeſt take notice of my Prayer, but thou doeſt not take notice, of this Circumſtance: Yes, (ſaies he) <hi>I know thy works, and where thou dwelleſt, even where Satans ſeat is.</hi> Well, <hi>and thou holdeſt faſt my Name, and haſt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:162405:47"/>not denied my faith, even in thoſe daies wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was ſlain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</hi> It's remarkable, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt takes notice, not only of our Duty; but of every Circumſtance of the Duty, and ſo he preſents it unto God the Father, not only the Duty, but the Circumſtance of the Duty; and therefore there is not a haire of your Duty loſt, not one graine of your Duty loſt: is not this an unſpeakable Comfort unto a poor ſoul, that it knows that nothing is loſt of all the Prayers it hath made unto God, that there is no loſſe at all? The very pantings of our hearts at the Throne of grace, are received into the boſom of our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Further, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Is it not a Comfort for a man to have liberty to go unto the Mercy-Seat, and there for to meet with God?

               <p>Once more, Is it not a Comfort, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> for a poor begger to be relieved at a rich-mans door?

               <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Did you never find in your heart (you that make this Objection) to Pray, and Cry, and Intercede for others, for the godly eſpecially? Look what diſpoſition there is in your heart towards the members of Chriſt, there is the ſame diſpoſition in Chriſt's heart towards you. Ah! do you think that there is love in your boſome towards the Saints; and that there is none in Chriſt's heart towards you? Do you think that your bowels are more large than Chriſt's? Canſt thou find in thine heart to go unto God, when thou ſeeſt a Saint in miſery, to go to God, and pray, and cry, and intercede for him? and don't you think that the Lord Jeſus hath as much bowels towards you, to go and intercede for you, and preſent your prayers unto God the Father.</p>
               <p>Further, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Don't you look upon your own Duties, as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from your ſelves, moſt unworthy? Beloved! 'tis in regard of Duties, as it is in regard of Perſons: When a man does judge himſelf to be moſt unworthy, then Chriſt counts him worthy, God counts him worthy in Chriſt. As you reade in the 1. of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> ſaies the Spouſe there, ver. 5. <hi>I am black (O ye daughters of Jeruſalem) as the tents of Kedar: Look not upon me becauſe I am black, ver.</hi> 6. Now would you ſee Chriſts opinion of her, that counts her ſelf black? ſaith ſhe, <hi>Black,</hi> and <hi>Black again:</hi> but Chriſt ſaith concerning her; verſe, 8. <hi>O thou faireſt among women.</hi> She calls her ſelf <hi>Black,</hi> and Chriſt cals her <hi>Fair,</hi> and <hi>the Faireſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong women.</hi> Now, when a man doth count himſelf moſt unworthy, God counts him moſt worthy: and when a man looks upon his own Duties, and Sacrifices, as moſt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, they are look't upon by Jeſus Chriſt as moſt worthy, poor prayers in our eyes, are precious in Gods eye.</p>
               <p>A word more, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Don't ye think, that grace is larger now, in the times of the Goſpel, than it was in the times of the Law? If ye doubt it, as unto this particular; Look upon the 30. Chapter of <hi>Exodus;</hi> compared with the 41. of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel.</hi> In the 30. Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> The Lord commands an Altar to be made to burn incenſe upon; <hi>Of Shittim wood
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:162405:48"/>ſhalt thou make it;</hi> verſe the 1. <hi>A cubit ſhall be the length there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> verſe the 2. The Altar is for Incenſe; 'tis the matter that now we are upon: <hi>A cubit ſhall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and two cubits ſhall be the highth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> Now in the 41. Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> he ſpeaks of the Altar in the times of the Goſpel: and (ſaith he) at the 22. verſe, ('tis the Altar of incenſe that there is preſcribed to be made, the Altar of wood, of Shettem wood.) <hi>The Altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits.</hi> And yet again, this altar of incenſe in the times of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is to be as large again, as that in the times of the Law; as high, and as long, and as large again. In the times of the Law, times of the old-Teſtament; a poor ſoul might go unto the High-Prieſt, and might challenge a right in him, and might ſay, That his Service, and his Duty, and his Sacrifice was accepted by the High-Prieſt. If in the times of the Old-Teſtament a man might ſay ſo; much more may a poor ſoul now go unto Jeſus Chriſt, our great High-Prieſt, and ſay, That his Service, and his Duty, and Sacrifice, is accepted through him. Here is abundance of Comfort unto the Saints: be of good comfort, all you that do beleeve.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>How doth this make unto our Holineſs,</hi>

We confeſs indeed, that there is abundance of Comfort in this, That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, our great High-Prieſt, takes all our Gifts, and al our Prayers, and preſents them to God the Father, and that in his acceptance, we have acceptance: but I pray, how doth all this conduce to our Holineſs of life?</hi>
               </p>

                  </label> 
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, In caſe I be Ungodly, a Wicked man: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Here is that that may for ever keep me, from oppoſition to the good wayes of God. I have ſaid ſometimes (may a wicked man ſay) concerning godly mens duties, That it was their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie: And I have ſaid concerning ſuch and ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, This is your Pride, and this is your Singularity; and I have oppoſed with all bitterneſs, and earneſtneſs, the prayings, and wreſtlings of ſome of Gods people? But is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:162405:49"/>this true, That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, takes every Prayer, of the meaneſt of Gods Children, and carries it into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of God the Father? and ſhall I ſpit upon that that Chriſt owns? ſhall I dare to oppoſe that that the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt preſents unto his Father? The Lord in mercy pardon me: I have ſinned and done fooliſhly, and for ought I know, I may have ſpoken evill of that Duty, that Chriſt hath carried into the preſence of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Oh! through the Lords grace then, for ever will I leave to make any oppoſition, againſt any of the good waies of God again, and I will never ſpeake one word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the perſons, meetings, or ſupplications of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly again.</p>
               <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In caſe a man be Ungodly, a wicked man: Here is mighty incouragement, for to come unto Jeſus Chriſt; I, and to come preſently. For, is Jeſus Chriſt the ladder that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw, by whom we go up to Heaven? doth he take all our Duties, and Prayers, and preſent them to God the Father for acceptance? Then, till I do come to Chriſt, all is nothing, all is loſt: if I be a Drunkard, and will not come to Chriſt, Prayer is all loſt; if I be a Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and will not come to Chriſt, an Unclean wretch, and will not come to Chriſt; all my Prayers, and all my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are loſt: Oh! the Lord pity me, (may many a poor ſoul ſay) I have loſt too many Prayers already; through the Lords grace, now I will loſe no more: Oh! I come to Chriſt, Lord, I come, I come. This is a mighty incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, to make every man now for to come unto Jeſus Chriſt: becauſe the Lord Jeſus, our High-Prieſt, takes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Duty; and carries it into the boſom. of God the Father for acceptance. Thus for Ungodly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In caſe a man be Godly; this truth doth conduce to our further Holineſs, and growth in grace.</p>
               <p>If I be Codly: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Then here I ſee infinite reaſon, why I ſhould be much in Duty; not only pray, but be much in prayer. Why? for the Lord Chriſt taketh all, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries all into the boſom of the Father, mingles his own o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:162405:49"/>interceſſions with it, although it be but a ſigh, and a groane. The Apoſtle upon this account, makes this uſe of it; having ſpoken of Chriſt our High-Prieſt; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſaith he) <hi>let us come with boldneſs vnto the Throne of grace.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16</note> The word ſignifies, to ſpeak all ones mind; let us come <hi>ſpeaking all.</hi> Having ſuch an High-Prieſt indeed, as will carry all into the preſence of God the Father, for accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, every ſigh, and every groan; then, who would not be much in prayer? ſpeak all to Chriſt, be free with Chriſt, <hi>come with boldneſs?</hi> There's many a poor ſoul, that is much diſcouraged, and he dares not go to prayer, many times, afraid to go to the Throne of grace. The reaſon is, becauſe he looks upon his Prayer, or Duty, as it lies upon his own heart, or as it comes from himſelf. Whereas, my beloved, 'tis with your Prayers, and Duties, as it is with fire: Your kitchin fire is troubled with abundance of ſmoake, and there is filth about it; fire upon the hearth hath much ſmoake: but fire above, in the Element of fire, there's no ſmoke. So, your Prayer, when it lies upon your own hearth (as I may ſay) there's a great deal of ſmoke; but when it gets once into the hands of Jeſus Chriſt, there's it's Element, and it is freed from all it's ſmoke. Or as it is with a mans Body: ſo long as he lives here upon the earth, he is feeble, and weak, and many times ſickly: aſſoon as he is come into Heaven, all his weakneſs is taken away, and his body being in Heaven, 'tis preſently glorified, and ſtrength put upon it, and all his diſeaſes are gone. So 'tis with our Prayers: So long as they are here below, in our own boſoms, they are full of weakneſs; but aſſoon as our Prayer is out of our mouth, 'tis in the hand of Chriſt, 'tis in Heaven, 'tis glorified, the weakneſs is now done away; Oh! 'tis a glorified Prayer; when once 'tis gone from you, 'tis in the hand of Chriſt. And therefore, this is a mighty incouragement unto all thoſe that are godly, to be, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Prayer, but to be much in Prayer, come with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto the Throne of grace.</p>
               <p>Again, If ye be Godly; yea, if ye be Ungodly: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Here I
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:162405:50"/>ſee infinite reaſon, why I ſhould receive every Truth that comes from Chriſt, though accompanied with many fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in him that ſpeaks it. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of every prayer, and duty that comes from me; though it have many weakneſſes: yea, he takes my Prayer, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it into the preſence of God the Father for acceptance, my poor Prayer, labouring with many weakneſſes: Then when a Truth comes from Chriſt, ſhall not I accept of it? what though the Miniſter, or Preacher that ſpeaks it, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with this or that weakneſs? There is Pride, or there is ſome miſcarriage in the delivery, or the like: Shall the Lord Chriſt take my Prayer, labouring under infirmity, and accept thereof, and carry it into the preſence of God the Father for acceptance, notwithſtanding all the failings of my Duty? and ſhall not I accept of Truth that comes from Chriſt, notwithſtanding all the failings of the poor meſſenger that brings it?</p>
               <p>Further, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>The more Evangelical you are in your Obedience, the more Holy ye are in your lives.</hi> This truth that is now before ye, well ſtudied and conſidered, will make you more Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in an Evangelical way. And ye ſhall find therefore, that the Lord himſelf from Heaven does make this uſe of it: pray conſult with the 17. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the 5. verſe. <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed: hear ye him.</hi> Thoſe words follow, <hi>Hear him.</hi> Hearing notes Faith, and Obedience; not a bare Hearing with the ear. Compare this, and the ſame ſpeech together, which ye have in the 3. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the 17. verſe. <hi>Loe, a voyce from Heaven, ſaying, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Heare ye him, is not there in the 3. of <hi>Matthew;</hi> but here in the 17. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> theſe words are added, Heare ye him: What ſhould the reaſon be, that, Hear ye him, ſhould be added here in the 17. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and not in the 3. of <hi>Mat. thew?</hi> Give me leave to give you ſome reaſon for it, ſo far as may make to our preſent purpoſe: Not to ſay any thing of that which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, In his daies a Prophet will the Lord your God raiſe up unto ye like unto me, hear ye him.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:162405:50"/>And now here, in this 17. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> at the transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> appeared, which they did not in the 3. of <hi>Matthew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Conſider, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that the Emphaſis may lie upon the word <hi>Hear,</hi> and not upon the word <hi>Him,</hi> only: <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed: Hear ye him;</hi> His face did ſhine as the Sun, and his rayment was white as the light. And Chriſt appeared in great glory, and they ſtood looking upon him; Nay, (ſaies the Lord from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) do not make it a gazing matter, but, Hear him: don't ſtand looking upon him, but Hear him. He don't appear in ſuch a glory in the 3. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> when he was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; and therefore thoſe words are not added there.</p>
               <p>But again, Here now in the 17. Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> at the Transfiguration, appears <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi> Behold (at the 3. verſe) <hi>There appeared unto them,</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Elias <hi>talking with him. Moſes</hi> that gave the Law; <hi>Elias</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored it. <hi>Then anſwered</hi> Peter <hi>and ſaid unto Jeſus; Lord, 'tis good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here Three Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles; one for Thee, and one for</hi> Moſes <hi>and one for</hi> Elias. <hi>Peter</hi> and ſo the reſt of the Diſciples, began for to equallize <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt: One for <hi>Moſes,</hi> and one for <hi>Elias,</hi> and one for Jeſus Chriſt; no more for Chriſt than for <hi>Moſes.</hi> Now the Lord takes <hi>Peter</hi> off from all his miſtakings: Your eye is upon <hi>Moſes</hi> (ſaith he) but I (ſaith the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty) am wel pleaſed in my Son: This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed. I am well pleaſed with you, and with your Duties, through this my Son, and not through <hi>Moſes;</hi> and therefore Hear Chriſt, and not <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> He laies this in upon it, that therefore they ſhould be Evangelical, and hear Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe the Lord Chriſt gives acceptance unto all, and by him God is well pleaſed with them.</p>
               <p>Again further, <hi>The more glory Chriſt does appear in,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>the greater reaſon there is why we ſhould hear him.</hi> Now here the Lord Jeſus Chriſt appeared in glory; his face did ſhine as the Sun, and his raiment was white as the light. In the 3.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:162405:51"/>of <hi>Matthew,</hi> he was there baptized, and he did not appear in glory: but now here he appears in glory; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaies the Lord, now <hi>Hear him;</hi> this is your glorious Saviour, Hear him. Beloved! what greater glory can Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt appear to your ſouls in, than this, the glory of his love? he takes every one of your Duties, and your Prayers, and he carries them in to the boſome of God the Father, and by him you have acceptance. Oh! what a glorious Saviour have ye! therefore Hear him: This is that, if any thing, will make ye very Obedient to Chriſt, more than to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to be Evangelical in all your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>Yet further, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                  <hi>The more a man can rejoyce in ſpiritual priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with humility: and the more humble a man is, and yet can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in his ſpiritual priviledges, the more holy he is:</hi> there goes a great deal of Holineſs to it, to joyn theſe two together: for a man to rejoyce in his ſpiritual priviledges and yet to be humble: and to walk very humbly. Some there are, that look upon ther ſpiritual priviledges, and rejoyce much; but they don't walk humbly: Some labour to walk humbly, and are much troubled in the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their own evil; but they don't rejoyce in their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual priviledges. Give me a Chriſtian that doth both, and he is a bleſſed man. The ſtudy of this Truth that is now before you, will teach you to do both, to do both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether For, what a great priviledge is this, not a figh, not a groane, not a duty, but the Lord Chriſt takes it, and carries it in, and preſents it to God the Father for me, whereby I have acceptance? Conſidering this; here is matter of much joy and rejoycing. I but, It is Chriſt that does it; there is no ſuch worthineſs in mine own duty; it were loſt, and caſt away, if Jeſus Chriſt did not take it in his hand, and carry it into the boſome of God the Father; and therefore, why ſhould I not walk humbly.</p>
               <p>I conclude all with this, If that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, our great High-Prieſt, offers up all our Gifts unto God the Father, whereby we have acceptance: What infinite
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:162405:51"/>cauſe have we all to be Thankful to God for Chriſt, and to love Jeſus Chriſt for ever!</p>
               <p>Suppoſe one of you had been among the Diſciples, when the Lord Chriſt waſh't his Diſciples feet; and he ſhould have come, and waſh't your feet, and have done it; would not your heart have glowed with love to Jeſus Chriſt? Yet when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt waſh't his Diſciples feet, it was in the daies of his fleſh, when he was here on the earth: but now he is in glory, and yet for all this, he takes your dirty prayers, and does (as it were) waſh the feet of your prayers, that he may preſent them to God the Father: he waſhes your tears over again in his bloud, and preſents them to God the Father: he takes all your Duties, and perfumes them with his interceſſions, and ſo preſents them unto God the Father. Oh! what cauſe have we to love Jeſus Chriſt! Oh! you, that never loved Chriſt, love him now; and you that have loved him before, love him much more: you that fear the lord, love the Lord: and let us all, even go away with our hearts warmed with this love, bleſſing, and praiſing the Name of the Lord.</p>

                  <hi>and of Chriſt, conſiſteth in Spiritual things eſpecially, and not in Temporal.</hi> And therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, in that 1. of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and the 3. verſe: <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us, with all Spiritual bleſſings, in Heavenly places in Chriſt.</hi> The Curſe, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, that do befal men now under the Goſpel, are not in outward afflictions, and bodily troubles ſo much; as in Spiritual miſeries, Blindneſs of mind, and Hardneſs of heart: And ſo alſo on the contrary, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Goſpel, doth not conſiſt much in Outward things, as in Spiritual, <hi>Who hath bleſſed us with Spiritual bleſſings.</hi> Indeed, if we look into the old Teſtament we
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:162405:53"/>ſhall find, That when <hi>Moſes</hi> did bleſs the people, he bleſt them much in Temporal bleſſings. in the 28. of <hi>Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and the 2. verſe. <hi>All theſe things ſhall come upon thee, and overtake thee, if thou ſhalt hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God.</hi> What bleſſings are thoſe? <hi>Bleſſed ſhalt thou be in the city, and bleſſed ſhalt thou be in the field: bleſſed ſhall be the fruit of thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattel, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of thy kine, and the flocks of thy ſheep: bleſſed ſhall be thy basket and thy ſtore.</hi> Thus he goes on in outward bleſſings. But now, if we look into the Goſpel, and conſider the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of Jeſus Chriſt, and lay them together with <hi>Moſes,</hi> we ſhall find them to be Spiritual bleſſings. In the 5. of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> and the 3. verſe, &amp;c. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for their's is the Kingdom of Heaven: Bleſſed are thoſe that mourn, for they ſall be comforted.</hi> Indeed the promiſe of the earth comes is at the 5. verſ; but he returns again to Spiritual bleſſings: <hi>Bleſſed are they which hunger and thirſt after right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; for they ſhall be filled. Bleſſed are the pure in heart; for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> Here are Spiritual bleſſings; this is the ſtream of the Goſpel, it runs this way. When the Lord bleſſeth a man, he gives him that which is ſutable to him. In the times of the Goſpel, men are more Spiritual than they were in the times of the Law; therefore Goſpel-bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, they are Spiritual bleſſings. Every thing gives, and communicates to another, according to what it hath it ſelf: The Sun communicates light unto the world; becauſe it hath light it ſelf: And man communicates the nature of man unto his child, becauſe he hath the nature of man himſelf. So our Lord Chriſt, when he Bleſſes, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates according unto what he hath himſelf; and his bleſſings eſpecially conſiſting in ſpiritual things, ſo he doth bleſſe. Indeed, as in the times of the Old Teſtament there were Spiritual bleſſings, that were mixt with Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, by vertue of the Covenant that was made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> So now, Outward bleſſings are thrown in as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verplus: but yet notwithſtanding, though they be not ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual in their nature, they are ſpiritual in their end; and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:162405:53"/>ſo it is true to ſay, That the bleſſing of the Goſpel, and of Chriſt is a ſpiritual bleſſing.</p>
               <p>But more particularly, if yet ask me wherein this conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? I ſhall name but Two things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, This Bleſſing of the Goſpel, or of Chriſt,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                  <hi>it conſiſts in a ſupernatural, and ſpiritual injoyment of God in Chriſt, the love and favour of God in Chriſt.</hi> When the Prieſts bleſt in the time of the old Teſtament, in that 6. of <hi>Numbers,</hi> they ſaid, <hi>The Lord cauſe his face for to ſhine upon you. The Lord make his face for to ſhine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee: the Lord bleſſe thee, and keepe thee. Verſe,</hi> 24, 25, 26. Which the Spoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expounding, in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> the 13. Chapter and the 14. verſe, renders it thus: <hi>The grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the communion of the holy Ghoſt, be with you all. Amen.</hi> The Lord bleſſe thee, the Lord cauſe his face to ſhine upon you; the Lord lift up the light of his countenance upon you: Three times, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord; noting the <hi>Trinity;</hi> which the Apoſtle here explains by the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>holy Spirit. Bleſſed are the pure in heart:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8</note> 
                  <hi>for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> Seeing of God, is a bleſſing out of the mouth of Chriſt, a Goſpel-bleſſign. And what is it for a man to ſee God? In the phraſe of the old Teſtament, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, to <hi>See,</hi> it is ordinarily uſed for to <hi>Injoy.</hi> In the 4. <hi>Pſalme. Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> The word in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew is, Who will make us to <hi>See any good?</hi> that is t <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy good.</hi> So then, to ſee God, it is to injoy him. When <hi>Jacob</hi> injoyed God, he ſaw him; and the place it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Peniel;</hi> for he had ſeen the Lord, and there the Lord bleſt him. There's no ſeeing of God but in Chriſt. And therefore I ſay, that herein confiſts the bleſſing of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, in a ſupernatural, and ſpiritual in joyment of God in Chriſt, the favour and love of God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again, It conſiſts alſo, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>in the Inhabitation of the holy Ghoſt in our hearts: the giving out of the holy Ghoſt unto the hearts of men.</hi> And therefore it is added in that place of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians; And the Communion of the holy Ghoſt, be with you all.</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:162405:54"/>
                  <hi>Amen.</hi> That muſt needs be the great bleſſing of the Goſpel, and ſo of Chriſt; that is the thing promiſed in the Goſpel. What is that? If we look into the 1. Chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, and the 4. verſe, It is ſaid there of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>That they ſhould wait for the promiſe of the Father.</hi> Chriſt commaded them that they ſhould not depart from Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, but wait for the promiſe of the Father. What is that? We know what it was, and is, that which befel afterward; it was the giving out of the holy Ghoſt: the holy Ghoſt fell upon them, &amp; this is called THE <hi>promiſe of the Father.</hi> That as in the times of the Old Teſtament, the promiſe was, the giving of the Son, and coming of the Second Perſon: So after Chriſt came, the great promiſe was, the coming of the Third Perſon, and the giving of the holy Ghoſt. <hi>When I am gone</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I'le ſend ye another Comforter. He that beleeveth, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water.</hi> This he ſpake concerning the Spirit, which was not yet given, in thoſe extraordinary emanations of giſts and graces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not yet gloriſied. So then, the great Bleſſing that was to be given unto the children of men, the great Goſpel-bleſſing, was the giving out of the holy Ghoſt: this is a Goſpel-bleſſing indeed.</p>
               <p>Well, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> 
                  <hi>But what doth Chriſt do, when he doth Bleſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's obſervable, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> that when any Superiour did Bleſſe; a father did bleſſe his child, or the like, he did obſerve what was the choice mercy, and good in thoſe times, and he did wiſh that unto his child, or unto his inferiour. And ſo in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacobs</hi> time; the choice good it was, The dew of Heaven: and when they did bleſſe their children, they wiſh't unto them the dew of Heaven. So now, when our Iord Jeſus, our great High-Prieſt doth bleſſe any man; obſerving that the choice mercy of the Goſpel, is the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in Chriſt, the favour and love of God, and the giving out of the holy Ghoſt into a mans heart; he doth wiſ all this good unto him, and he ſaies unto God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Lord, let this poor ſoul have thy favour; Oh! cauſe thy face to ſhine upon this poor ſoul, and give out the holy Ghoſt unto it that it may walk after the ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:162405:54"/>
               <p>In the Second place, It's obſervable, That when the Prieſts did Bleſſe the people, they did not barely wiſh good unto them, but they did Authoratatively pronounce them bleſſed.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.27.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſhall put my name upon them (ſaith the Lord) when they bleſs.</hi> So when the Lord Chriſt, our great High-Prieſt, doth Bleſſe a man, he does not barely wiſh him good, The Lord cauſe his face for to ſhine upon that ſoul, in a way of wiſhing: but the Lord Chriſt being a High-Prieſt, when he bleſſeth, he doth authoratatively pronounce ſuch a ſoul to be Bleſſed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When the Prieſt Bleſſed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> he did not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the people Bleſſed: but in the Bleſſing of the Prieſt, there was a kind of Binding-power; it had the power, force, and efficacy of an Abſolution. And therefore as Chriſt ſaies unto his Diſciples, <hi>Go, and whoſoever ſins ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, they ſhall be remitted:</hi> I'le ſtand by you in it. So ſaith the Lord in that ſame place, the 6. of <hi>Numbers. On this wiſe ſhall ye bleſs the children of Iſrael, ſaying unto them, The Lord bleſse thee, and keep thee.</hi> and at the 27. verſe, <hi>They ſhall put my Name upon the children of Iſrael, and I will bleſſethem.</hi> I'le ſtand by them in this. So when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, our great High-Prieſt, doth Bleſſe; he doth not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a man to be Bleſſed, but he doth Abſolve him from all his ſins; &amp; (ſaith he) by authority that is given to me from my father, the Keyes that are put into my hand, I do Bind this bleſſing upon this poor ſoul.</p>
               <p>Further, The Prieſt when he bleſſed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> indeed he could wiſh well, and he could pronounce a man bleſſed; and he might Abſolve: but he could go no further, he could not confer the Bleſſing, he could not beſtow the Bleſſing: But our Lord Chriſt, being an High-Prieſt beyond all the High-Prieſts that ever were before him in this reſpect too; where he doth Bleſſe, he beſtoweth the Bleſſing, being God and man, he beſtoweth the Bleſſing.</p>
               <p>In the Fifth place, This our great High-Prieſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> being God and Man; look how God Bleſſeth, ſo doth he Bleſſe. In the Scripture, ye ſhall find, That when God the Father
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:162405:55"/>Bleſſed, he ſaid unto thoſe things that he bleſt, <hi>Increaſe and Multiply:</hi> ſtill when he bleſt, <hi>Increaſe and Multiply.</hi> So the Lord Jeſus Chriſt our High-Preiſt, when he comes to bleſſe, he doth not barely wiſh good unto a poor ſoul, or pronounce him bleſſed, or beſlow a good thing upon him; but ſaith he, <hi>O ſoul, Multiply in this good;</hi> the Lord increaſe thy Graces, and thy Gifts, and thy Comforts; poor ſoul, Increaſe and Multiply herein. This the Lord Chriſt our great High-Prieſt doth. Thus it's cleer what the Blſſing of the Goſpel is, wherein it conſiſts; and what our High-Prieſt doth, when he doth bleſſe the people.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>2</label> 
                  <hi>Does this Bleſſing properly, or ſpecially belong unto Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes,<hi>Anſw.</hi> For he was made a curſe for ſin; he and none elſe made a curſe for ſin: and therefore it belongs unto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the world for to bleſſe. For look what evil Jeſus Chriſt endured, the contrary good he merited for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, a power to beſtow that good. Now he above all was curſed, hung upon the Croſſe, and died a curſed death, he was made a curſe; therefore it belongs unto him above all for to give the bleſſing, for to bleſſe poor ſinners. <hi>Primum in quolibet genere &amp;c.</hi> The firſt in every kind is the cauſe of the reſt. The Sun is the cauſe of all the light we have here below, and 'tis the firſt light body. And the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he is the firſt bleſſing: Therefore hath they God bleſt thee for ever. There are Three that we reade of in Scripture eſpecially that did bleſſe: The Father, the King, and the Prieſt: The Father did bleſſe his Children; the King bleſt his Subjects, and the Prieſt bleſt the People. Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt He is our Father, <hi>The Everlaſting Father;</hi> He is our King, <hi>I will ſet my King upon my holy hill;</hi> And he is our great High-Prieſt: and therefore, all theſe relations meeting in him, it belongs unto him above all for to bleſſe the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt Willing for to Bleſſe poor ſinners,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

                  </label> He is very Willing: this bleſſing of the people, it
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:162405:55"/>is a work whereunto he is much inclin'd, and wherein he is moſt delighted. Ye ſhall obſerve therefore, what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of bleſſings Chriſt ſcattered among the people when he was here upon the earth. Ye don't reade that ever he curſed any man, formally curſed him: Once indeed, he pronounced a Curſe, but it fell upon a barren fig-tree, not upon a man: But take your Bibles, and turne over from leaf to leaf, and ſee how frequent he was in bleſſing: and conſider whether you do reade in al the Bible, of any Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, or Prophet, that ever in the way of their preaching, pronounced ſo many Bleſſings as Chriſt did? He begins bleſſing, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor;</hi> and <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe that mourn;</hi> and <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe that hunger and thirſt;</hi> and <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe that are perſecuted for my Names ſake: Bleſſed are thoſe that hear the Word of God and keep it: He took little children into his arms and Bleſt them.</hi> Do but mark in all the Goſpel, how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Chriſt was in Bleſſing, never in Curſing; more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in bleſſing, than ever any Preacher was in all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: What's the reaſon of this? Becauſe this work of Bleſſing the people, is a work wherein the Lord Jeſus Chriſt our High-Prieſt, is much delighted, a work whereunto he is moſt in clined.</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>But doth he do it?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>For Anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> 
                  <hi>It is a hard thing (ſometimes) unto a Chriſtian for to diſcern-this Bleſſing of Chriſt.</hi> Ye can ſee the Boughs,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:162405:56"/>Fruit, Body, Bark of the Tree; but if ye will ſee the Root, ye muſt dig, and take pains for to ſee it: it's an eaſie thing to ſee the Leaves, &amp;c. but if you would ſee the Root, ye muſt dig and take pains for it. This Bleſſing of Jeſus Chriſt, it is the Root of all; and if you will ſee this, you muſt dig and take pains to ſee it, it does not lie open to every ones view. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt our High-Prieſt, does not Bleſſe as man bleſſes; and ſo his Bleſſing is very much hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from our eyes; he does not bleſſe as we do; he does not bleſs as the world does: if the world ſees a Rich man, it pronounces him bleſſed: Oh! there's a bleſſed man, and there's a happy man! what an excellent Dwelling hath he, how healthful! his Table is ſpread &amp;c. The world bleſſes Rich men, pronounces them Happy and bleſſed. But our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he does as <hi>Jacob</hi> did; when <hi>Joſeph</hi> brought his two Sons to <hi>Jacob</hi> to be bleſt by him; he ſet <hi>Ephraim</hi> the younger at the left hand of <hi>Jacob;</hi> and he ſet <hi>Manaſſes</hi> the elder at the right hand of <hi>Jacob;</hi> that <hi>Jacob</hi> might give the right-hand bleſſing to the Elder, and the left-hand bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the Younger: but when <hi>Joſeph</hi> had ſet them thus before <hi>Jacob, Jacob</hi> croſſes hands, and he turns the right-hand bleſſing to the Younger. So, two men are brought before Chriſt; a Rich man (it may be) and a Poor man: and in the eye of the world, the Rich man muſt carry the bleſſing: Oh! but our Lord Chriſt, he croſſes hands, and he laies the bleſſing upon the younger brother many times. And ſo in regard of Ordinances. Two ſorts of Ordinances are brought before Chriſt; Gods Ordinance, and Mans Ordinance; and Mans Ordinance, in the eye of the world, is the Elder brother, and Gods Ordinance the Younger brother; and both theſe are brought before Chriſt for a bleſſing, and the Ordinance of Man is ſet at the right hand of Chriſt by the world; but the Lord Chriſt, he croſſes hands, and he laies the bleſſing upon the younger brother in this reſpect. And ſo, two men are brought before him; a proud Phariſee, and a poor broken-hearted ſinner; the Phariſee comes unto the right-hand of Chriſt, &amp; thinks for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:162405:56"/>to carry the bleſſing: but the Lord Chriſt, croſſes hands, &amp; laies the right-hand bleſſing upon the poor broken-hearted ſinner, and paſſes by the proud Phariſee. The Lord Chriſt doth not bleſſe as the world bleſſeth.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>As he doth not Bleſs as the World Bleſſeth,</hi>

                  <hi>ſo he doth not Bleſs alwaies as Profeſſors Bleſs.</hi> Profeſſors, they do ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bleſſe men, according unto their outward Priviledges, Goſpel, and Church-Priviledges: Oh! ſaies the woman unto Chriſt, <hi>Bleſſed is the womb that bare thee: and bleſſed are the paps that gave thee ſuck.</hi> Chriſt croſſes hands. Nay but (ſaies Chriſt) <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe that hear the word of God, and keep it, and do my Commandements.</hi> You bleſſe according to Outward Priviledges; I don't go that way of bleſſing, ſaies Chriſt: He does not bleſſe as Profeſſors bleſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>He does not bleſſe as Godly men do bleſſe alwaies;</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>3</label> 
                  <hi>as Gracious men bleſſe, not alwaies.</hi> For, you that are Godly, you pronounce ſuch a man bleſſed, as hath much Grace, and hath Aſſurance of the love of God in Chriſt; and one that hath ſtrong, and great Parts, and able to carry away whole Sermons word for word; and of ſtrong Memory, and large Gifts, that are head and ſhoulders above their fellows: But the Lord Jeſus Chriſt does not alwaies bleſſe thus: <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit,</hi> ſaies he. <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe that mourn.</hi> He don't ſay, Bleſſed are thoſe that rejoyce; or, Bleſſed are thoſe that have the Aſſurance of Gods love; or, Bleſſed are thoſe that are ſtrong in grace: No, but do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou know a poor, weak Chriſtian, a mourning ſoul like a dove of the vallies; ſaies the Lord, I bleſſe him.</p>
               <p>Thus I ſay, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt our great High-Prieſt, he does not Bleſſe as We bleſſe; he does not bleſſe as the World bleſſes; he does not bleſſe alwaies as Profeſſors bleſſe; he does not bleſſe alwaies as Godly men Bleſſe; and therefore no wonder that his Bleſſing is hidden. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when they are very young, are often bleſt by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and they don't mind it, or take notice of it; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of two or three year old: And ſo it is with many a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:162405:57"/>gracious ſoul, bleſſed by Jeſus Chriſt, and don't take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their fathers bleſſing. But the Lord Chriſt doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies bleſſe his people; only, there are ſeveral times, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſeaſons that he gives out his bleſſing: let me tell ye of thoſe times a little, that ſo ye may come for his bleſſing while his hand is in, as it were: ſo that you may be crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſpiritual bleſſings in and from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>When Chriſt our High-Prieſt doth ſee that a man is weak in Grace, or weak in Gifts, and hath ſome work, or ſervice for him to do, ſome imployment to call him forth unto; then the Lord Chriſt doth Bleſſe him.</hi> There are Two times eſpecially (as I remember) that the Lord ſpeaks thoſe words concerning man, <hi>Increaſe and Multiply.</hi> Once in the beginning, when he had made man and woman; And once in the 9. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> when he had brought <hi>Noah</hi> out of the Ark: Why does he rather chooſe for to ſpeak thoſe words, <hi>Increaſe and Multiply,</hi> at theſe Two times eſpecially, rather than at any other time? In the beginning there was but a little ſtook of man-kind, and the Lord had a deſign upon man, to make uſe of him in the world; and therefore in the beginning ſaies he, <hi>Increaſe and Multiply:</hi> but afterward, that the floud had ſwept away man, <hi>Noah</hi> and his family being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, when he came out of the Ark, the Lord having yet a further deſign upon man, to uſe him, he reneweth thoſe words again, <hi>Increaſe and Multiply.</hi> So when the Lord Chriſt ſees, that a mans heart is upright, and ſincere with him, and he hath ſome work and ſervice for him to do, then the Lord comes forth and bleſſes him; O ſoul, <hi>Increaſe</hi> and <hi>Multiply,</hi> increaſe in thy Gifts, and Graces, and <hi>Multiply.</hi> That is one.</p>
               <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>As the Lord doth bleſſe weak Gifts, and Graces, when he intends to uſe them: ſo alſo, when as he hath made uſe of a man; when a man hath done the work of God, and done it to purpoſe, then the Lord bleſſes that man. Melchiſedec,</hi> a great Type of Chriſt, here when <hi>Abraham</hi> had been upon a great ſervice, ſlaying Kings, and reſoued <hi>Lot,</hi> then <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> the High-Prieſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> comes forth and bleſſes him. So when the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:162405:57"/>Chriſt our great High-Prieſt, ſees that a poor ſoul hath been upon his work, upon his ſervice, and hath done his work faithfully; then he comes forth and bleſſes that ſoul, <hi>O ſoul, live for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, As he does bleſſe at this time, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> when a man hath done his work; ſo alſo, when a man is willing for to leave all his Relations, and natural ingagements for to follow him, to cleave cloſe unto him, and to his waies, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. The Lord bleſſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> Thou ſhalt be bleſſed. <hi>In Bleſſing I will Bleſſe thee, and thou ſhalt be bleſſed.</hi> Upon what occaſion? <hi>Abraham</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>get thee out of thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and go to a land, and place that I will ſhew thee.</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did ſo, <hi>Abraham</hi> puld up his Tent, and went after the Lord, and left his own Relations: and thereupon the Lord fell upon him, and bleſt him. So when the Lord Chriſt our High-Prieſt, ſees a ſoul willing, even to trample upon his Relations for to follow him; willing to leave all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ingagements for to be his ſervant; then the Lord Chriſt comes out, and ſaies he, This ſoul do I bleſſe: <hi>In bleſſing I will bleſſe thee, and I will bleſſe thee exceedingly.</hi> That is a Third time.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Lord Chriſt our High-Prieſt, does bleſſe,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                  <hi>when the world Curſes. a ſpeciall time of Chriſts bleſſing is, when the world Curſes.</hi> When <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> reviled, blaſphemed and Curſed, then God bleſt. When <hi>Balak</hi> hired <hi>Balaam</hi> for to Curſe the people of Iſrael, then the Lord bleſt them by the mouth of <hi>Balaam</hi> himſelf. And ye ſee what Chriſt ſaies to this purpoſe, in that ſame 5. chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> at the 10. verſe. <hi>Bleſſed are they which are perſecuted for righteouſneſſe ſake:</hi> But when are they bleſſed? <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile you, and perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſly for my ſake. Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall perſecute you.</hi> I but, ſuppoſe it don't come to a bodily perſecution, men may not be thrown in priſon, or brought to the ſtake. Saies he, <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall Revile,</hi> perſecute you with the tongue, <hi>and ſay all manner of evil againſt you for my ſake.</hi> When the world ſaies of ſuch a poor ſoul, That he is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:162405:58"/>an Hypocrite, a diſſembler, and ſpeaks all manner of evil that can be diviſed againſt a poore ſoule for the Name of Chriſt; that is the very time, that Chriſt comes for to bleſs that ſoule, then doth Chriſt bleſſe; it's a bleſſed ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>In the Fift place, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
                  <hi>The Lord Chriſt does alſo Bleſs, when as Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do graciouſly injoy the Ordinances, purely, and Evangelically adminiſtred.</hi> It is ſaid concerning <hi>Zion,</hi> There command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he his bleſſing for ever,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſa.</hi> 89.15.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed are the people that hear the joyful ſound: they ſhall walk in the light of his countenance.</hi> It is written of the Prieſts in the times of the Old-Teſtament, that when the people, the Congregation were come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they bleſt them: when the People were come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the injoyment of Ordinances according to Gods own appointment, then the Prieſts bleſt them. And did their High-Prieſt bleſſe them then? and ſhall not our High Prieſt do it now? Did their High-Prieſt bleſſe them when they ſate under Moſaical Ordinances? and ſhall not our High-Prieſt bleſſe the people that ſit under Evangelical, and Goſpel-Ordinances purely, &amp; Evangelically adminiſtred? The people then might make account of the greateſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; and ſo may you do alſo, of the bleſſing of Jeſus Chriſt when thus you do enjoy Ordinances. Only there is this difference: (other differences there are, but this only I ſhall ſpeak of) Then the Prieſt did bleſſe the people when the Congregation was diſmiſt: but now, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt our great High-Prieſt, he is bleſſing of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation all the while; he is going up and down in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation all the while that the Word is preached, and Ordinances adminiſtred, and he is bleſſing poor ſouls, as they ſit longing after him, and ſighing towards him; he is bleſſing of them all the while. Thus he does bleſſe, and though you don't alwaies perceive it, yet he doth bleſſe his people. <label type="milestone">

               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:162405:58"/>
               <p>Firſt for <hi>Comfort,</hi> Beloved, <hi>Is it not a Comfortable thing to be bleſſed by Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Children counted it a great matter to be bleſt by their parents. when as <hi>Jacob</hi> had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Bleſſing from <hi>Eſau; Eſau</hi> goes and fits down, and mourns, he could not be comforted becauſe the bleſſing was gone: and <hi>Jacob,</hi> though he were thruſt out of doors, yet becauſe he had gotten the Bleſſing, he went away cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and it was but an <hi>Iſaac's</hi> Bleſſing. But behold a greater then <hi>Iſaac</hi> is here! Oh! was it ſuch a matter to have an <hi>Iſaac's</hi> Bleſſing? what is it then to be Bleſſed by Jeſus Chriſt? Beloved! when as Chriſt doth bleſs, he turns all our Curſes into Bleſſings, and our Miſeries into Mercies. When God Curſes, he turns our Table into a Snare: and when Chriſt Bleſſeth, he turnes our ſnare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Table, quite contrary. <hi>Jacob</hi> pronounced a Curſe upon his two ſons, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> (you know upon what occaſion) They ſhould be divided and ſcattered in Iſrael: afterward the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> ſtands up at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God to execute Juſtice &amp; Judgment, &amp; the Lord bleſt them: And how did he bleſs them? They were to be the Preachers unto all the Tribes; and ſo that they might be Preachers unto all the Tribes, they were to be ſcattered into all the tribes, &amp; ſo <hi>Jacobs</hi> curſe was turned into a bleſſing to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is it not a Comfortable thing, for a man to have all his Curſers, to be Bleſſers?</hi> It's a Comfortable thing, for all a mans Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to become Bleſſings: But now I ſay, it's a Comfortable thing, for al a mans Curſers, to be Bleſters to him. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord Chriſt Bleſſes, he will make mens Curſers, whether they wil or no, (in the day of their viſitation at leaſt) for to Bleſs. Ye know that <hi>Balaam</hi> would have Curſed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but the Lord had bleſt them. <hi>Balaam</hi> got upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a high mountain, and from thence he would have Curſed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but it would not be. Then he gets upon another high Mountain, &amp; from thence he would have Curſed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but it would not be. Then he gets upon another high Mountain: thinking that would have done it, and from thence he would have Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but that would not do it. Oh! ſaies he, <hi>The
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:162405:59"/>Lord hath ſeene no iniquity in Iſrael, and therefore he Bleſſes them:</hi> the Curſe is turned into a Bleſſing: So there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that deale thus by the people of God in theſe daies: They get upon ſuch a high Mountain, ſuch a great and high means, and they think to Curſe the people of God from thence, but it won't be. Then they get upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mountain, another means, thinking from thence to Curſe the people of God, but it will not be. Then they get upon another high Mountain or hill, and think then to Curſe the people of God, and do them miſchief, but it will not do it. Why? for the Lord Chriſt ſees no iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Lord Chriſt hath bleſt them: and ſo at laſt, in the day of wicked mens viſitation, they are forced to ſay, <hi>Theſe are the people of God, and theſe are Bleſſed, and ſhall be bleſſed.</hi> We know what is ſaid in the Scripture, <hi>The bleſſing of the Lord maketh rich: and he addeth no ſorrow therewithal.</hi> Is it not a good thing then, to be bleſt by Chriſt? If a man be bleſſed by Jeſus Chriſt, he may bleſſe himſelf in the Lord, and he may comfort himſelf in every Condition, and he may ſay thus, Well, though I be a Poor man, yet I am bleſt by Chriſt: And though my Eſtate be ſunk, and decai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet I am bleſt by Chriſt: And though I be reproached, and hated by men, yet I am bleſſed by Jeſus Chriſt; a man may comfort himſelf in every condition.</p>

                  <hi>Indeed if a man be aſſured that Chriſt hath bleſt him, he may do thus; but I am afraid that Chriſt hath not bleſt me, or that he is not willing to bleſs me: if I could be aſſured, that this great High-Prieſt, had once laid his hand, his bleſſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand upon me, I ſhould have comfort in all conditions.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> When the Lord bleſt <hi>Abraham,</hi> he ſaid unto him, <hi>In thee, and thy ſeed ſhall all Nations be Bleſt.</hi> It's a ſign unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he was bleſt, becauſe others were bleſſed by him. So now, when a mans Parts, Gifts, Graces, and Comforts are bleſſings to others, it is an argument that that man is bleſt himſelf.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:162405:59"/>
               <p>Further, When a man is bleſſed by God, or Chriſt; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he is drawn nearer to God by all outward things, by all things: <hi>Come ye Bleſſed,</hi> Go ye Curſed. Bleſſing hath an attractive Nature, <hi>Come ye Bleſſed:</hi> when the Lord Chriſt does bleſs a man, he does draw him, <hi>Come ye Bleſſed.</hi> When a man is brought nearer to God by Affliction, he is bleſſed: when a man is brought nearer to God by his Eſtate, by any Comfort, by any Sorrow, here is bleſſing, <hi>Come ye Bleſſed.</hi> Bleſſing draws one nearer to God with a cord of love.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Where the Lord does Bleſs, he does cauſe a man to Increaſe and Multiply, in that thing wherein he is Bleſt.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Multiplying, is ſo natural unto Bleſſing, that in the Original tongues of the old and new Teſtament, <hi>Plenty</hi> is put for <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> I will give you but one clear place for it in the new Teſtament, the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. Chapter, 5. verſe. Therefore I thought it neceſſary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto ye, and make up before hand your <hi>Bounty.</hi> The word is, your <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you had notice before; that the ſame might be ready <hi>as a matter of Bounty.</hi> The word is, <hi>as a matter of Bleſſing.</hi> But eſpecially in the next verſe. But this I ſay, he which ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſparingly, ſhal reap ſparingly: and he which ſoweth bountifully, ſhall reap bountifully. <hi>And he which ſoweth with Bleſſing</hi> (as it is in the Original) <hi>ſhall reap with Bleſſing:</hi> And here 'tis oppoſed to Sparingly, and tranſlated Bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Where the Lord does bleſſe, he does alwaies cauſe a man to Increaſe and Multiply.</p>
               <p>Now beloved in the Lord, I appeal unto all your ſouls, you that make this Objection, that are afraid the Lord Chriſt hath not bleſt you as your High-Prieſt, hath not laid his hand upon you, and bleſt you: yet don't ye know more of Chriſt than ye have known before? hath not the hidden truths of the Goſpel been increaſed and multiplied upon your hearts? hath not your hearts been brought nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to God by Affliction? hath not your ſouls been drawn neerer to God by his outward dealings with you? And as <hi>Abraham</hi> was therefore bleſt, becauſe he was made a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:162405:60"/>to others: So I appeal to ye, have not your Parts, Gifts, and Graces, in ſome meaſure been bleſſings unto others, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto your poor Family, and unto others alſo? Then be of good Comfort (man or woman) where ever thou ſtand'ſt, the Lord Chriſt hath bleſt thee, and thou ſhalt be bleſſed, hold up thy head poor bleſſed ſoul, the Lord Jeſus hath bleſt thee: when the Lord did lay this bleſſing upon thee, I cannot till thee, but I find thee a bleſſed man, ſtay thy ſelf upon the Lord, cheer up thy drooping heart, thou art a bleſſed ſoul.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, <label type="milestone">

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> This holds forth great incouragement, unto all poor ſinners for to come to Chriſt, and to come without delay. Why? Once come to Chriſt and bleſſed; but without Chriſt and Curſed: an enemy to Jeſus Chriſt and a Curſed man: Curſed in thy ſtore-houſe: Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in thy basket; and Curſed in all things that thou putteſt thine hand unto. Oh! then, will you not come to Chriſt, that you may be Bleſſed: That day that a poor ſoul comes unto Chriſt, whatever he hath been he is bleſſed: that day may be called <hi>Gilgal,</hi> for then the Curſe is rouled away from him. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is forgiven, and whoſe ſin is pardoned.</hi> The firſt day, the firſt minute that he comes to Chriſt, his ſin is pardoned, and he is bleſſed. Who would not then come unto Chriſt preſently, that he may be bleſt for ever? When as <hi>Eſan</hi> had ſold his Birth-right for a meſs of pottage, the Lord look't upon him as a Prophane man, and he ſtands upon record in Scripture for a Prophane man unto this day, becauſe he ſold his Birth-right. And ſaies the text, <hi>Though he ſought the Bleſſing</hi> (it was a bleſſing) <hi>with tears, he never recovered it.</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he is now among us, and offering to bleſs us; and if I will rather keep my ſins than come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord will look upon me as a Prophane
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:162405:60"/>man; and I may go and ſeek the bleſſing with tears, and never recover it again. Oh! here's that (me thinks) that ſhould make every wicked man; if there be ever a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, Swearer, or Unclean wanton that reades this book, mind what is ſaid for your Everlaſting peace: I ſay, here's that (me thinks) that ſhould make every wicked man, to look upon the Godly, as <hi>David</hi> did upon the ſparrows, and upon the ſwallows: Saies <hi>David, Theſe birds full nigh thine Altar may, have place to ſit and ſing:</hi> as ye have it in your ſinging Pſalms. Theſe birds can come and make their neſts; but as for me, I am kept at a diſtance: He was provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the ſparrows, and ſwallows making their neſts neer the Altar. So may a wicked man ſay, There's a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man indeed, he may go to Jeſus Chriſt, he may go to Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, and he may offer up his Gift to God the Father by the hands of Chriſt, he can come neer to God by Chriſt: But as for me, I am yet without Chriſt, I am not yet gone to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; I am ſuch a curſed Swearer, I am ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Drunkard, I am ſuch a vile, wretched Wanton, ſuch a Notorious, Scandelous ſinner: Oh! theſe people are bleſſed, but I am Curſed, but now through the Lords grace I will go unto the Lord Chriſt that I may be bleſſed.</p>
               <p>Yea, My beloved, here is (me thinks) a ſtrong Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unto all thoſe that are young people for to come unto Jeſus Chriſt: even thoſe that are very young. Hear the word of the Lord ye Children. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Children into his armes, and he bleſt them. You that are nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old; you can be ſolicitous for your fathers bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and have gone down upon your knees often unto your father, and you have ſaid, Pray father, pray to God to bleſs me. Oh! will ye go to your outward father for his bleſſing? and will ye not go unto Jeſus Chriſt? He is an Everlaſting Father, this your earthly father will be dead erelong; He is an Everlaſting father (children) and he is able to bleſs ye, and willing to bleſs ye. Have ye gone
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:162405:61"/>down upon your knees to your outward father? Oh! chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, down, down upon your knees before the Lord Jeſus Chrit, and go to him for his blſſing. Some of you (it may be) never went yet to Chriſt for his bleſſing; ye have lived ſo many yeers, ten, eleven, or twelve yeers, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver went to Chriſt as a High-Prieſt, for his bleſſing all this while: Oh! what a mighty incouragement is here unto all men to come to Chriſt, that they may be bleſſed by him.</p>
               <p>But yet further, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As there is an incouragement for to come unto Chriſt: <hi>So this argument does alſo incourage us to go on in the good waies of Chriſt, notwithſtanding all oppoſition that we meet withall:</hi> (I ſay) it does ſpeak incouragement, to go on in the face of all oppoſition. For when <hi>Abraham</hi> had been at battel, then came <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> the High-Prieſt to bleſs him: And when a poor ſoul goes out to battel for Chriſt, then comes our great <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> our High-Prieſt, and bleſſes that ſoul. The time of oppoſition, it is the time of Chriſts bleſſing. Therefore, why ſhould I be dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, or beaten out of the way of Chriſt, by reaſon of any oppoſition, though it be never ſo great? Times of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition are Chriſts bleſſing-time.</p>
               <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> This argument, does not only ſpeak incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt all oppſition: <hi>But it does alſo incourage us to go on in the good waies of God when we are called unto it, though we have but little ſtrength, and weak parts.</hi> Though there be but little oyle in the Cruſe, though there be but little meal in the barrel, if Chriſt call to the work, he will bleſs a man in it: and when Chriſt bleſſes, he does multiply and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe a mans parts in the uſing of them. As when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to ſit down, and eat, he did multiply, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the bread in their eating: So now, does Chriſt call me to any work or ſervice, well then, though I am weak, though I have not oyle enough, though I have not meal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, though I have not ſtrenght enough; yet the Lord Chriſt will bleſs, and when he bleſſes, he does increaſe and multiply: and therefore, why ſhould I not go on upon his
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:162405:61"/>work, if he do call mee thereunto, though I have never ſo little ſtrength.</p>
               <p>And yet further, If all this be true: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Why ſhould not a man be contented with his condition, though it be never ſo mean? Beloved in the Lord! is there not enough in Chriſts bleſſing? Truly, He is too covetous, whom the bleſſing of Chriſt will not ſatisfie. Well, what ever my condition be, yet I may be bleſſed by Jeſus Chriſt; and hath the Lord bleſt me? then will I be contented with my Condition, though it be never ſo mean, I have-<hi>All,</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> onceſaid, <hi>I have All.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea in the Fift and laſt place: Here is that, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> (which if wel ſtudied and conſidered) will provoke us all for to bleſs the Lord, and continually to bleſſe the Lord! What is the life of a Chriſtian here, but a continuall bleſſing of God? 'tis Heaven begun: and in Heaven, they do nothing elſe, but bleſſe and praiſe the Lord; and, I ſay, our life here, is Heaven begun: and therefore a Chriſtian ſhould be alwaies bleſſing and praiſing the Lord.</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>But what will make a man to be alwaies Bleſſing,</hi>

               <p>To conclude al; give me leave to cal upon you, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what ye have read. Ye have read, <hi>That it is the work of our great High-Prieſt, To Satisfie for the ſins of the people. To anſwer unto all Accuſations that are brought againſt them: To

In caſe that you be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any ſpiritual Want, or Temptation; put your ſouls unto this Disjunction: Come, O my ſoule, Either the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is our great High-Frieſt; or elſe he is not: If he be not, what means this and that Scripture? And if the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be our great High-Prieſt; then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he being faithful, will do all the work of the High-Prieſt for my ſoul. Indeed I have ſinned, and ſinned greatly; but O Lord, it is the work of our High-Prieſt to Satisfie: Now, Lord Jeſus, I come to thee as mine High-Prieſt, Oh! Satisfie for me. Indeed, I confeſſe, mine own <hi>Conſcience</hi> does Accuſe me, <hi>Satan</hi> does Accuſe me, <hi>Moſes</hi> does Accuſe me: but it is the work of our great High-Prieſt, to take off all Accuſations brought againſt poor beleevers: Now Lord, I do come unto thee, as to my great High-Prieſt, Oh! take off this Accuſation that any poor ſoul does labour under. Indeed, when I look upon mine own Duties; there is ſo much deadneſs, ſo much hardneſs of heart, and ſo many diſtractions that do accompany them, that I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid they will never be accepted: but, O Lord, it is the work of our great High-Prieſt, to take away the weeds of the Duty, and to preſent the Duty; now O Lord, I come unto thee as mine High-Prieſt, Oh! carry my Prayers into the boſom of God the Father. Yea, when I look upon my former life, Lord, I cannot but conclude my ſelf, a poor curſed finner: but yet notwithſtanding, it is the work of our great High-Prieſt, for to bleſſe the people: O Lord, I do therefore now come unto thee as mine High-Prieſt, Oh! bleſſe me, and ſay unto all my graces, <hi>Increaſe and Multiply.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Scope and Drift of this Epiſtle, is to raiſe and ſtrengthen the faith of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,</hi> and ſo the faith of thoſe that are weak in grace. Our Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (whom I take to be the Pen-man) labours to diſcover the tranſcendent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Jeſus Chriſt, with his love and good-will to the Children of men. And becauſe his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, were either ſuch as relate his <hi>Perſon;</hi> or ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his <hi>Offices,</hi> of King, Prieſt, &amp; Prophet: He tels us in the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:162405:63"/>firſt Chapter, that for the Perſonal Excellencies of Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>He is the Son of God; Heire of all things; by whom were the Worlds made: being the brightneſs of his Fathers glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon,</hi> in the 2, &amp; 3. verſes of that Chapters. <hi>That he is far above the Angels,</hi> at the 4. verſe. That he is <hi>God himſelf,</hi> at the 6. verſe. And as for thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies that relate his <hi>Offices:</hi> He tels us at the 1. verſe, That he is the <hi>Prophet of Prophets.</hi> That he is the <hi>great King,</hi> at the 8. verſe. That he is an <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> in the 2. Chap. and the 17. verſe: and therefore who would not truſt unto him, and take heed unto ſuch things are he ſhall ſpeak unto them. And as for <hi>the love, and good-will that he bears unto the Children of men;</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks it out in all this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter.</p>
               <p>The greater Condeſeention in the perſon loving, to the perſon loved, the greater is the love. Now though Jeſus Chriſt be Heir of all things; and had all things put under his feet; far above all Angels: yet notwithſtanding, at the 7. verſe, <hi>He is made a little lower than the Angels, takes our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The more Profitable any love is, to the perſon loved, the greater is the love. Such is the love of Chriſt; for his love is ſuch, That <hi>by him many ſons are brought to glory,</hi> at the 10. verſe. <hi>Sanctified while they live,</hi> at the 11. verſe. <hi>Satan their deadly enemy ſubdued for them,</hi> at the 14, &amp; 15: verſes.</p>
               <p>The more Diſtinguiſhing any love is, the greater is that love. Now Jeſus Chriſt, as the great Load-ſtone, paſſes by the golden mettel of Angels, and draws unto himſelf the Iron-mettal of man kind, at the 16. verſe: <hi>For verily, he took not on him the nature of Angels; but he took on him the ſeed of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</p>
               <p>Again, The more the perſon loving, does Suffer for the perſon loved, the more and the greater is the love. Chriſt ſuffered death, and he was while he lived ſubject to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and unto our temptations: <hi>He was in all thing made like unto us,</hi> at the 17. verſe. <hi>And he was tempted as we are tempted, that he might ſuccour thoſe that are tempted,</hi> at the 18. verſe.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:162405:63"/>
               <p>And would you have an Account, or a Reaſon of all this? it is, that he might ſhew mercy unto the children of men, verſe the 17. <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful High-Prieſt, in things partaining to God, to make reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the ſins of the people.</hi> If he were not made like unto us in regard of our infirmities, he could not ſo experimental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pity us under our infirmities: If he were not <hi>tempted</hi> like unto us, he could not ſo <hi>feelingly</hi> ſuccour us under our temptation; and ſo he had not been ſo fit to have benn our High-Prieſt: but our High-Prieſt he is gone into the holy of holieſt, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people. Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto us, that he might be a merciful and faithful High-Prieſt: <hi>For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered being tempted, be is able to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them that are tempted,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not hold you longer in the Coherence, or Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the words, or further Explication: I ſhall open the words (God willing) more particularly, and diſtinctly, as I ſhall come to the Obſervations that ſhall be raiſed from them. And I begin with the laſt, being made the reaſon of the former. <hi>For in that he him ſelf hath ſuffered being temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> Tempted twice: He <hi>tempted,</hi> and They <hi>tempted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This word <hi>Tempted,</hi> or <hi>Tempt;</hi> it is given in Scripture phraſe, ſometimes to <hi>God,</hi> ſometimes to <hi>Man,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the <hi>Devil;</hi> and accordingly it is uſed <hi>Three waies:</hi> Sometimes it is uſed for to <hi>Prove;</hi> and ſo <hi>God</hi> is ſaid for to Tempt, in the 13. of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> Sometimes it is uſed for to <hi>Try, to make experiment of a Thing, or a Perſon, whom or which we did not know before;</hi> and ſo it is given to <hi>Man</hi> (as I take it) in the 6. of <hi>Judges.</hi> Sometimes it is uſed for a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation,</hi> and <hi>Drawing unto what is evil;</hi> and ſo it is given unto the <hi>Devil,</hi> in the 4. of <hi>Matthew, Chriſt was led into the axilderneſs to be tempted.</hi> If ye look into the Scripture, ye don't find in all the old Teſtament, that the word <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is given to Satan, that Satan was ſaid to Tempt any:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:162405:64"/>Satan did frequently Tempt, we reade in the old Teſtament; but I ſay, the word Tempt is not given unto him. Satan tempted <hi>Job,</hi> but <hi>Job's</hi> afflictions in the old Teſtament, are not called Satans temptations. As our Lord and Saviour Chriſt in the old Teſtament was Vail'd, the old Teſtament was full of Chriſt, yet Chriſt was hidden there: So was Satan and his temptations mask't. Now when the light of the glorious Goſpel ſhined more cleerly in the comming of Jeſus Chriſt, as Chriſts vail was taken off, ſo Satans Mask was taken off; Satans temptations are no longer cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led afflictions, but bare Temptations, throughout the new-Teſtament. Indeed, this word <hi>Temptation,</hi> in the phraſe of the new Teſtament, is uſed ſometimes for <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> Sometimes for Satans <hi>Suggeſtions;</hi> ſometimes for our <hi>own Sins. Temptation</hi> uſed for our <hi>Afflictions:</hi> in the 1. of <hi>James,</hi> 2. verſe, <hi>Rejoyce when ye fall into divers temptations.</hi> That is, <hi>Afflictions.</hi> Sometimes for the <hi>Devils ſuggeſtions, Solicitations to evil.</hi> So in the 4. of <hi>Matthew, Chriſt is led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wilderneſs to be tempted.</hi> Sometimes for <hi>our own ſins. Galatians</hi> the 6 chapter, and the 1. verſe. <hi>If any man be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with an infirmity, you that are ſpiritual, reſtore him, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that you alſo may be tempted.</hi> Now though our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>Tempted,</hi> in the two firſt reſpects, and not in the third; yet when it is ſaid here in the text, <hi>He himſelf hath ſuffered being tempted;</hi> I take it to be meant in the ſecond way, not the firſt: for otherwiſe, there would be an identity thus: He himſelf hath ſuffered; having ſuffered; that would be the ſenſe of it elſe. And though we our ſelves are ſaid to be tempted in all three reſpects, In regard <hi>of Afflictions, Satans Suggeſtions,</hi> and <hi>our own Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and Sins;</hi> yet when it is ſaid in the latter end of the verſe, <hi>He is able to ſuccour them that are tempted;</hi> I take it to be meant eſpecially in he two laſt reſpects, and not in the firſt: for it hath relation unto that which goes before the laſt verſe being a reaſon of the latter end of the 17. verſ. <hi>To make reconciliation for the ſins of the people, for in that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath ſuffered, being tempted, he is able to ſuccovr them that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:162405:64"/>are tempted.</hi> Hence the Obſervation that I ſhall preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you is only this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God doth ſuffer his own Servants, and deareſt Children,</hi>

                  <hi>to be ſorely tempted. Yea, even to ſuffer by the hand of the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, the Son of God, the only Beloved Son of God, yet ſaith the text, <hi>He himſelf hath ſuffered being tempted:</hi> not only <hi>tempted,</hi> but <hi>ſuffered being tempted.</hi> And it is ſaid, <hi>of his Brethren,</hi> (for ſo his people are called, in the beginning of the 17. verſe) that they are tempted: <hi>He is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.

               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Saints and People of God do thus ſuffer, and why?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Anſwer to an Objection; and ſo come to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</hi>

                     </gap>
                  </note> it is not uſed again in the new Teſtament, (as I remember)
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:162405:65"/>But in other Authors that uſe it, it ſignifies ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring, as when one man does challenge another into the field to a Duel: Or ſuch a Deſiring, as when a man comes and cals for open, and publick Puniſhment upon a man: and all this is <hi>Suffering,</hi> and <hi>Afflictive.</hi> Or, as your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation hath it: Satan hath deſired <hi>to Have you.</hi> He does not ſay thus: Satan hath deſired <hi>to Sift you;</hi> but Satan hath deſired <hi>to Have you.</hi> Is it not an affliction to a child, to hear a Begger ſtand craving, and begging of his father to have him away, to carry him away from his houſe? There is never a Temptation, but in that Temptation Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan deſires to Have you, you that are the Children of God, Satan deſires to have you. Then again, <hi>He hath deſired to have you that he may [ſift you as wheat.]</hi> Now though in ſif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, there is a ſeparation between the <hi>Chaff</hi> and the <hi>wheat,</hi> yet it is not without a concuſſion, and a ſhaking of the wheat: the wheat and the grain is ſhaken, though the chaffe be blown aſide, and laid on heaps. And though through the skil of the ſifter, the wheat may be ſo kept, as it does not fal into the chaffe-heap; yet notwithſtanding, there is ſome danger in ſifting, that the grain ſhould fall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into the heap of chaffe, and be burnt with the chaffe: So here. Eſpecially where Satan, the great deſtroyer of man-kind, hath the fan in his hand: Saith Chriſt, <hi>Satan hath deſired to have you,</hi> and hath deſired to have you, <hi>that he may ſift you as wheat;</hi> and I tell you, there is ſo much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in it, that nothing but my prayer can ſecure you, <hi>But I have prayed for you.</hi> So that you ſee, there is ſomething of a Suffering in a Temptation. You know it was a Law in the old Teſtament, that if a woman were abroade in the fields, and there met her ſome that offered violence to her; if ſhe cryed out, and did not conſent, ſhe was not guilty: but now, though ſhe were not guilty, but inocent, if ſhe were abuſed, it would be a continual affliction, to a modeſt good woman. So it is here, Satan comes to meet us, and though we do not conſent to him, yet a gracious heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but look upon it as an affliction, to be thus followed,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:162405:65"/>and haunted with a Temptation. And the holy Ghoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to this practiſe, when he ſaith here in the text, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is able to ſuccour:</hi> The word <hi>Succour,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> ſignifies ſuch a Succouring as brings in help unto thoſe that cry out; to come in, and run in with help upon ones crying out. In the 12. of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Woe to the inhabitants of the earth; for the Devil is come down with great wrath, for he knows that his time is ſhort.</hi> There is a Woe in it, where the Devil comes down with great wrath. Now he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the Saints, as having their time but ſhort, and he comes down upon them in great wrath with his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and there is a Woe in it, although the temptation takes not: And for ought I know, upon this account, the new-Teſtament may ſo promiſcuouſly uſe the word <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> both for <hi>Affliction,</hi> and <hi>Satans Suggeſtions,</hi> even becauſe ſeldom any Affliction comes, but it does bring Temptation with it: never any Temptation but brings Affliction: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſomething of a Suffering in every Temptation, even at that very time when it does leaſt prevail. This is the Firſt thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Doth God ſuffer his own children thus to Suffer?</hi>

                  <hi>the beſt men meet with the worſt temptations, thoſe that are moſt eminently Godly, are moſt fouly aſſaulted. David, Job, Peter, Paul,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf was. Yea, God doth not only ſuffer Satan to come, and preſent evil objects before his ſervants, but ſuffers him to go ſo far, as to ſolicite, to preſs, to follow on his temptation. And therefore it is ſaid concerning <hi>David, That Satan ſtood up, and provoked him to Number the people.</hi> He did not only preſent an evil object to him, but he followed his temptation, he ſolicited, he ſtood up and provoked <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> to Number the people.</p>
               <p>Yea, <hi>God doth not only ſuffer this: but at that very time, when the Saints have had moſt of God, then they have ſuffered by the hand of temptation.</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> had been taken up into the third Heaven, then a meſſenger, Satan was ſent to buffet him. And when Jeſus Chriſt had heard the voice, <hi>This is
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:162405:66"/>my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed:</hi> Then (ſaies the text in the 4. of <hi>Matthew</hi> 1.) <hi>was he led by the ſpirit into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, to be tempted of the Devil.</hi> And ſo with the Saints now: when they have been, as it were, in the third Heaven with God, when they have had moſt of him, when they have heard the Lord ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved child;</hi> after ſpecial manifeſtations of his love, then moſt tempted: Oh! who would be ſecure, after manifeſtations of Gods love?</p>
               <p>Further, God doth not only ſuffer it thus far: but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he ſuffers his children to be ſo far tempted, as they ſeem to have the worſer, Satan the better; Satan taking the wall of them, the upper hand, In the 3. of <hi>Zachary,</hi> it is ſaid concerning <hi>Joſhua: That Satan ſtood at his right hand:</hi> Satan took the wall of him, took the upper hand of him.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>God ſuffers this to be, and to continue a long time with ſome of his children. Paul</hi> ſaith, he had prayed <hi>thrice:</hi> that is, <hi>often;</hi> and all the anſwer he could get was this, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee, (Paul)</hi> I don't ſay, I will deliver thee, but thou ſhalt have grace enough to uphold thee, My grace ſhall be ſufficient. Thus God ſuffers his own dear children to Suffer under the hand of temptation.</p>
               <p>And would you know the Reaſon? <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> Good Authors ſay, <hi>That God ſuffers his own dear children to be tempted, that they may be more inlightened.</hi> Temptation inlightens the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; there by they are more experienced, and ſo more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened: God is pleaſed to anſwer them by this ſecret of thunder.</p>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:162405:68"/>
                  <hi>Touching,</hi> in Scripture phraſe, beſides the litteral ſenſe, ſometimes notes an <hi>Hurting,</hi> or <hi>Harming of one.</hi> So in the 105. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and the 15. verſe. <hi>Touch not mine anointed.</hi> Which is explained in the following words, <hi>and do my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets no harm.</hi> We reade of Chriſts Touching, and the Devils Touching. <hi>Chriſt touching</hi> thoſe that were ſick, and he cured them with his touch, it was an healing, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring touch, the touch of Chriſt. And we reade of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils touching:</hi> So he ſpeaks unto God that he would <hi>touch Job;</hi> that is, that he would <hi>break him,</hi> and break all his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: Chriſt touch is an healing touch, curing touch; but Satans touch is a deſtroying touch, a breaking touch. Now though God ſuffers his own children to be tempted, yea, and to ſuffer by the hand of a temptation, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the evil one touches him not, ſo as to harm him, to hurt him; But in the concluſion, ſo as to heal and to cure him, which is no touching.</p>
               <p>Again, This ſame word <hi>Touching,</hi> in Scripture Phraſe, ſometimes notes <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> and <hi>Communion:</hi> and ſo when the Apoſtle forbids the Corinthians fellowſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Idolaters; ſaith he, <hi>Be ye Separate, and touch no unclean thing.</hi> Touching there noting <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> with them in their Worſhip: don't in the leaſt meaſure have any communion with them.

               </p>
               <p>I come to the Application.</p>
               <p>If this be ſo:<note place="margin">Applyca.</note> 
                  <hi>Then why do you that are the Servants of God queſtion Gods love to you, and call your own condition into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on becauſe of your temptations, or becauſe of the hard things that you meet withall from the hand of your temptation?</hi> Oh! ſaies one, if God loved me, I ſhould never be thus tempted, I ſhould never ſuffer ſuch hard things by temptation as now I do: was there ever any of Gods Children tempted thus? Surely this cannot ſtand with grace. But was not Jeſus Chriſt tempted? Yes. But I am tempted many times to doubt of my Child-ſhip, whether I be the Child of God, Son of God I or no. And was not Chriſt thus? There were Two ſpecial times of Chriſts temptation: Once when he entered upon the Miniſtry: Once when he went out of the world; and you ſhall ſee, how at both theſe times, he was followed with this temptation: In the 4. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> there you reade of the firſt, and in the combate, twice, <hi>If thou be the Son of God?</hi> ſaies the Devil: putting an <hi>If</hi> upon his Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: and again, <hi>If</hi> thou be the Son of God: putting an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other If upon his Son-ſhip. So when he was upon the Croſs; the Devils Inſtruments ſpeak his own Language, they had not forgotten it: <hi>If he be the Son of God, let him come down?</hi> putting an <hi>If</hi> upon his Son-ſhip again. The Devil follows this cloſe. Oh! but I am tempted many times to uſe indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect means to get out of trouble, out of mine affliction. And was not Chriſt ſo? when he was an hungry, ſaies the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to him, <hi>Command that theſe ſtones be made bread.</hi> Oh! but I am tempted, I am loth to ſay what it is, ſometimes even to lay violent hands upon my ſelf. And what ſaid the Devil to Chriſt? <hi>Throw thy ſelf down off the pinacle of the Temple.</hi> Oh! but I am tempted to horrid and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous things that I am afraid to name, and my heart trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:162405:69"/>to think of. And was not Chriſt thus tempted? ſaies Satan to him, <hi>All this will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> What? worſhip the Devil! Oh! horrid blaſphemy! Bluſh, O Heavens, and be aſtoniſhed: <hi>All</hi> this will I give thee, If thou wilt fall down and worſhip me. Oh! but I am tempted to depair: ſometimes; I confeſſe I am able to reade Gods love, and to ſay, that God is with me, and I think I can ſay, I know that God is with me: but at another time, Oh! how unlike am I unto my ſelf, and I ſay, Mercy is gone, and Chriſt is gone, and hath left me as an orphan. And I pray conſider how it was with Chriſt in this reſpect; he went as neer to it as could be, without ſin. It is <hi>Muſculus</hi> his Obſervation. In the 16. of <hi>John: Behold</hi> (ſaies Chriſt at the 32. verſe) <hi>the hour cometh</hi> (ſpeaking of his ſuffering hour) <hi>Yea, it is now come, when ye ſhall be ſcattered every man from his own, and ſhall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone becauſe the Father is with me.</hi> (Speaking of his ſuffering hour) And yet when he was upon the Croſ, he ſaies, Father, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> How diverſe does he ſeem to be from himſelf? Saies he, I am not alone, becauſe the Father is with me: And yet when he comes into the hour, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Oh! but I have ſuffered as much as ever any did, I have ſuffered by the hand of my temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they have been a continual torment to me, and I have ſuffered much from them. Well, but have ye ſuffered more than Chriſt ſuffered? It is ſaid in the text, <hi>For in that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered being tempted:</hi> What a mighty ſuffering was it, for the glorious God of Heaven and Earth to have ſuch temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thrown in upon him? any one temptation to be lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in his mind, what a mighty ſuffering was this? Thus you ſee how Chriſt ſuffered.</p>
               <p>And beloved, <hi>He ſuffered, and was tempted, that he might ſuccour you that are tempted.</hi> Will you queſtion his love then, becauſe of your temptation, or your own condition? do ye know what you do? Suppoſe that your Father ſhould leave you a great Eſtate, and give you good Evidences; and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:162405:69"/>a cunning Lawyer comes, and writes upon the back-ſide of your Evidence, Naught, naught: will ye becauſe of that, joyn with him and ſay, that your Father hath given you nothing? Chriſt hath given you in a great Eſtate of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and hath given you good Evidences for it; and Satan now, comes &amp; writes upon the back-ſide of your Evidence, and ſaies, This is naught. Will you joyn with him againſt God and Chriſt? what wrong is this to his love? think of it, I pray, you that are the Saints and people of God: <hi>Be humbled under every temptation, though it be never ſo ſmall; but never queſtion your condition, though your temptation be never ſo great.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is indeed, ſomething of a ſuffering, a malignant quality, an affliction in every temptation when it takes leaſt: and therfore, look how you would walk under an afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo walk under your temptation. In your affliction, you will walk Humbly: ſo under your temptation do. In your affliction, you will examine the Cauſe, eſpecially if your affliction lie long upon you: So in your temptation do. In your affliction, you will ſeek God Early: So in the morning of your temptation do. In the day of your affliction, you will Engage to God; the day of affliction, is the day of engaging, and you ſay, Oh! if the Lord will deliver me, through his grace I will do ſo and ſo: So in your temptation do. In your affliction, you will take heed of thoſe ſins that you are moſt apt unto in the time of affliction: ſo do in the time of your temptation: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample thus: in affliction, a man is very apt to be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, to have his heart ſink and to die within him: So in temptation, take heed of that. In affliction, a man is apt ſo to mind his preſent burden, as to forgit all his former mercy: ſo in the time of temptation take heed of that. In the time of affliction, a man is very apt to be froward, and impatient, to break out into frowardneſs, and impatiency though he did not ſo before: As the wood that is laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fire, ſends forth filth which you did not ſee in the wood before it came upon the fire: So men are apt to ſend
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:162405:70"/>forth filth, and much frowardneſs and impatiency in the time of affliction, when you took them for good natured people before, and thought there was no ſuch frowardneſs in them, and no ſuch impatiency: So in the time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation alſo take heed of that. In the time of affliction, men are apt to make an evil conſtruction, and interpretation of things: Affliction raiſes Paſſion, and Paſſion puts other colors upon things than formerly; and ſo in time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, we are apt to make ſtrange conſtructions of Gods dealings, and Chriſt's dealings with us: take heed of that. In time of affliction, men are apt to change their behaviour; <hi>David</hi> did ſo, he let fall his ſpittle upon his beard, and faigned himſelf mad; he changed his behaviour: and ſo are men apt to change their behaviour in times of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: take heed of that. In time of affliction, men are apt to ſtint, and limit God, and ſay, Can God provide a table now? and can God deliver now? and ſo alſo in the time of temptation, men are apt to ſay, Can God provide now? &amp; can God deliver now? and ſo ſtint, and limit the Holy One of Iſrael; take heed of that. In the day of affliction a gracious heart does rather rejoyce that he hath any oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to exerciſe his grace, than mourn for his preſent bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: ſo do you now. In the day of affliction, a gracious heart doth more deſire to be cleanſed, than to be delivered; wiſhes rather that his heart may be ſanctified by his affliction, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that his affliction may be removed. There is ſomthing of a ſuffering (ye have heard) in every temptation: now then, does a temptation ariſe, and preſſe in upon you; Go to the Lord and ſay, Lord, though I meet with hard things from the hand of my temptations, &amp; theſe temptations have lien long upon me: yet I do rather chuſe Grace than Peace; rather to be Cleanſed, than to be Delivered: Oh! my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, how well might it be with us, if we did but improve our temptations? what againing day, what a learning day might the day of temptation be? yea, what an harveſt-day unto us, when Satan deſires to winnow us?</p>

It is an eaſie thing to keep a ſtone on the top of an hill, while it lies there; but when once it begins to roul down, it is a hard thing to ſtay it, and you cannot ſay how far it ſhall go: How many are there that ſay when they are tempted, I'le yeeld but once, I'le yeeld but a little, and I'le never yeeld again, this is the laſt time: Oh! but, your once yeelding, and your yeelding but a little, ingages your heart to the whole work. you ſhould watch and pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt temptation; <hi>Watch and pray that ye enter not into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi> he does not ſay, Watch and pray, that you be not tempted; but <hi>watch</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> that you <hi>enter</hi> not into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. 'Tis one thing for temptation to knock at the door, and another thing to come in: <hi>When temptation enters you, you enter into temptation;</hi> take heed of that.</p>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:162405:71"/>are the ſnares, and temptations of that condition.

               <p>Some again, they don't much mind their Calling to a condition, nor don't go in the ſtrength of their Call: whereas you ſhall obſerve, that when <hi>Peter</hi> was called to ſtand before the Princes, and Rulers, he did boldly profeſſe Chriſt, becauſe his call did lead him thereunto: but when he was not Called into the High-Prieſts hall, then he fals before a tempting wench. Others again there are, that think their condition wil ſecure them: Oh! ſaies one if I were but in ſuch and ſuch a condition, then I ſhould be ſafe and free from Satans temptations; whereas, ſeveral conditions, have ſeveral temptations: and the Devil does uſe ſometimes to tempt a man to alter his condition, ſo that by your very avoiding a temptation you fall into it.

                  <hi>If temptation do ariſe, obſerve the temptation; and know that there is ſome ſuitable diſpoſition of your own, wherein the Devil does lay that temptation, and labour to file, and pare off that diſpoſition.</hi> Beloved, the Devil obſerves the ſituation of our hearts, and accordingly does plant his Ordnance: he ſeldom tempts, but he laies his temptation in our own diſpoſition, ſomething ſutable unto the temptation. So when <hi>David</hi> had a mind to number the people, then the Devil ſtands up, and provokes him to number the people ſutable to his own diſpoſition. When our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt was an hungry, then he comes and tempts him to turn ſtones into bread. When again, he cryed out and ſaid, <hi>My God my God why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> then ſaies the Devils inſtruments, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, then come down and ſhew thy ſelf.</hi> He does uſually lay his temptation in our own diſpoſition that is ſutable to the temptation. And therefore, I ſay, firſt obſerve the temptation, then know you have a diſpoſition ſubſervient thereunto, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:162405:71"/>the Devil laies his temptation in that diſpoſition, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fals to work, and labours to file, and pare off more and more that diſpoſition in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>When a temptation ariſes,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                  <hi>don't alwaies ſtand to anſwer it in the kind, but ſometimes turn your mind and thoughts off it to another object.</hi> 'Tis in our deliverance from a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as in our comforts under an affliction: a man hath a great affliction upon him; poſſibly the death of ſome friend that is near and dear unto him, and you go to comfort him, and in comforting him, you fall a ſpeaking of his friend departed: whereas the way to comfort him, is not to ſpeak of the perſon departed, but fall into confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about ſome other good thing different; and by that time his heart is ſetled upon ſome other thing, then you may come back again, and ſpeak of the friend departed without grieving of him, but otherwiſe, even in your comfort you fetch out tears. And ſo I ſay in regard of temptation: the way to avoid temptation, is not alwaies to apply a ſalve directly pertinent to the temptation; but turn off your mind and your thoughts to ſome other good objects, and by that time your mind is ſetled upon other objects, you will be eaſily able to meet with the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Above all things take the ſhield of faith.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
                  <hi>Whom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt ſiedfaſt in the faith, Simon, Simon</hi> (ſaies our Saviour) <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath deſired to have you, that he may winnow you: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not:</hi> that muſt do it. That ſame woman that came to Chriſt for her daughter, ſhe met with great temptations: There was the temptation of her calamity; her daughter poſſeſt: There was a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts not anſwering, but delaying his anſwer. There was a temptation of Chriſts ſeeming denial; <hi>I am not ſent but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael:</hi> There was a temptation of her own unworthineſs; <hi>'Tis not lawful to take the childrens bread and to caſt it to dogs:</hi> yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſhe beleeves, Oh! ſaies our Saviour, <hi>Woman, great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</hi> And ſo I ſay, though
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:162405:72"/>your temptations be twiſted one within another, and one ſtands at the end of another; do but get the proſpect of faith, and you will be able to look over all. When temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation therefore ariſes, ſay, Lord, though thou kil me, yet will I truſt in thee: And Satan, though thou ſlayeſt me, I will keep to Jeſus Chriſt. It was the ſpeech of <hi>Taulerus,</hi> one that <hi>Luther</hi> prizeth above all: Saies he, Though the Marriners may make uſe of their Oars in the time of calm, yet when a ſtorm comes down, the Marriners leave all and fly to their Anchor. So, though at other times we may make uſe of Reſolutions, and Vows, and the like; yet when the ſtorm of temptation comes down, nothing then, but fly to the anchor of faith, nothing then like to caſting of anchor into the Vail. And as if the holy Ghoſt, put al on this, he cals <hi>Faith</hi> our <hi>Anchor;</hi> and he cals <hi>Faith</hi> our <hi>Shield:</hi> All dangers are either Sea-dangers, or Land dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: if your dangers be <hi>Sea-dangers, Faith</hi> is your <hi>Anchor;</hi> and if your dangers be <hi>Land dangers, Faith</hi> is your <hi>Shield.</hi> And therefore I ſay, when temptation ariſes, labour then to exerciſe your faith, and ſay, Oh! how ſhould I do this thing, and ſin againſt my Chriſt, and ſin againſt my God? Satan, thou telleſt me, All this I will give thee, if I wil do this thing: I but, how ſhall I do this, and ſin againſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt who hath loved me, and given himſelf for 'me? Satan, thou telleſt me, that if I do yeeld, God is merciful, and God will pardon me: Yea, but Satan, God hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd me already, and therefore I will not yeeld; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know that the Lord would pardon me if I did it, therefore I will not do it. Thus labour to exerciſe your faith in time of a temptation.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 
                  <hi>Be ſure of this, When temptation ariſes, don't fear too much: nor don't fear too little.</hi> I confeſſe, it's an hard thing to carry it equally, between too much, and too little: but (beloved) if you fear too Much; you honour Satan, you weaken your ſelves: immoderate fear weakens. And if you fear too little, then you grow ſecure: ſecurity betraies you, and ſo you loſe all before you ſtrike a ſtroke. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:162405:72"/>this Rule is: If temptation ariſe, don't fear too much, though the temptation be never ſo great: don't fear too little though the temptation be never ſo ſmall.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Art thou aſſaulted by temptation?</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 
                  <hi>Either you do overcome; or you are overcome: if you do overcome, be Thankful, leſt you loſe your former Victory, by your after-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nthankfulneſs. And if you be overcome, yet don't lay down the weapon, hold it up ſtill, ſtand upon your guard.</hi> The Devil tempts that he may tempt; and he is willing to be overcome in the skirmiſh, that he may overcome you in the battel: and he brings up the greateſt temptations in the reare: As <hi>Jobs</hi> afflictions were greateſt at that laſt: yea, he tempts us to break the Law, and ſin againſt the Law, that he may tempt us to ſin againſt the Goſpel. This is the Seventh Rule: If you be overcome, or be not overcome, walk thus.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, and Laſtly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 
                  <hi>If temptation do ariſe; Be ſure that you make ſome improvement of it for the better.</hi> If an enemy come and make an aſſault againſt one of your garriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towns, and he goes away, and gets no hurt, he is incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and invited to come again; for (ſaies he) I loſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; though I did not gain, and carry the Town, yet I loſt nothing: But now, if upon his aſſault he loſes many men, and his Ordnance, I'le come no more there (ſaies he) for there I had ſuch and ſuch a great loſte. Thus it is with Satan when he comes before a ſoul with his temptations; there is a ſoul (ſaies he) I came before him with my temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and though indeed I did not carry it, I did not get the thing I would, yet I loſt nothing, and therefore I'le go again. But there is a ſoul, and there's a heart, I came before him with my temptations, and I confeſſe I loſt much; I tempted and he prayed, and the more I temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the more he prayed, and the more I tempted ſtill, the more he did go to Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore I will tempt him no more. Beloved, labour to improve your temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, goe to God with your temptations in your hands, and pray over your temptations: and if you improve your temptations, you ſhall not be troubled
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:162405:73"/>with Satan; and therefore you are troubled with Satan ſo much, becauſe you improve your temptations no more. Oh! how well might it be with us, if we did but improve our temptations? what a good day would this be? what a good day might be this ſad day of our temptation, if we did but improve our temptations? And I beſeech you think of it, how we may improve them more and more. You know what our Saviour ſaid concerning the falſe ground; <hi>in the time of temptation it fell away:</hi> let that awe our hearts. You know what our ſaviour ſaies again by way of comfort unto his Diſciples; <hi>You continued with me in my temptations, and therefore I appoint unto you a kingdom:</hi> and bleſſed are they that do continue, and hold out this ſiege. Beloved! theſe turning times, are tempting times: and I think I may truly ſay, if ever there were an hour of temptation upon this kingdom, this is the hour of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands temptation, it is an hour of temptation. Oh! you that are the ſervants of God, and the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, will ye not watch with him one hour? an hour of temptation it is, but this is our comfort, it is but an hour: and therefore you that are his ſervants and Diſciples, will you not watch with him one hour? Watch and pray, watch and pray: ſome pray, but they will not watch; and ſome pretend to watch, but they don't pray. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I ſay to you, to my ſelf, and to all is, <hi>watch and pray:</hi> if you watch, you enter into your maſters joy; if you watch not, you enter into temptation: <hi>Oh! let us all watch and pray, that we enter not into temptation.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the word <hi>Tempted</hi> in the firſt clauſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Chriſt, we are to underſtand <hi>Satans ſolicitations to evil,</hi> (as ye have read in the former Sermon:) By the word <hi>Tempted</hi> in the laſt clauſe, <hi>He is able to ſuccour them that are tempted,</hi> ſpecially to underſtand thoſe ſolicitations of Satan and our own ſins, by comparing the former verſe with this. As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay: For in that our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt was tempted by Satan, ſolicited to what was evil; He is able to ſuccour them that are both, either ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to evil, or overcome thereby.</p>

As God indeed, he was able to ſuccour them that are tempted, though he had not been tempted: but he ſpeaks of Chriſt here as our High-Prieſt; and ſo by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tempted, he is able to ſuccor them in that way. There is, (as I may ſo ſpeak) a <hi>Scientifical</hi> ability, or an <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> ability. As he was God, he was able in the firſt ſenſe to ſuccour, 'tis true: but by being tempted, he is able <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally</hi> to ſuccour them that are tempted.</p>
               <p>It is an ability of <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion</hi> that here he ſpeaks of. And therefore in the fift Chapter, ſpeaking of the ſame thing, he ſaith concerning the High-Prieſt, <hi>That he can have Compaſſion on the ignorant, and thoſe that are out of the way.</hi> So then, Chriſt by being tempted, is able to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our thoſe that are tempted with an ability of <hi>Idoniety,</hi> an <hi>Experimental</hi> ability: with an ability of <hi>Compaſſion</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi> and gracious Inclination.

               </p>
               <p>In the former Doctrine ye heard, That God ſuffers his own ſervants, and deareſt children to be ſorely tempted: Now this Doctrine holds forth the remedy, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is a ſuccouring Chriſt to tempted ſouls.</hi> As our hearts are full of <hi>Sin,</hi> So his heart is ful of <hi>Succour,</hi> he is a ſuccouring Chriſt. His <hi>Names,</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> ſpeak him ſo. His <hi>Nature</hi> ſpeaks him ſo. His <hi>Officies,</hi> His <hi>Doctrine,</hi> His <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Converſation;</hi> His <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> call him a Succouring Chriſt.

               </p>
               <p>If we ſearch the Scripture, we may obſerve, That the Names of Satan, of the Devil, carry malice with them, and evil againſt them: And the Names of Jeſus Chriſt are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereunto, as holding forth a Succour againſt all that evil that is in him, who is <hi>The Evil One.</hi>

He is able by Conqueſt for to ſuccour you that are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: he is able by Conqueſt for to raiſe the Siege that is laid againſt our ſouls; he hath beaten through the Enemy: As now, if a Town be beleaguer'd ſtraightly, beſieged by an Enemy, and the Enemy abroad in the Field, having an army in the Field: if any will come to raiſe the Siege, they muſt fight through the Army, they muſt beat through the Army before they can raiſe the Siege. Never a tempted ſould but is thus beſieged with temptation, cloſely begirt, and the Devils were abroad in the field, were the Maſters of the field till Chriſt came: and no man, nor Angel was able to beat through: but Jeſus Chriſt beat up the Quarters all along, beat through the Enemy, caſt out Devils all along, overcame. <hi>Paul</hi> by being tempted overcame temptation. So by his dying he overcame death; and by taking our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities upon him, he overcame our infirmities; and by being ſubject to the Law, he overcame the Law, and the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:162405:77"/>curſe of the Law: and ſo by being tempted, he overcame temptation; and having beaten the Enemy out of the field he is now able to raiſe the Siege; he is abſolutely able to raiſe the Siege, which none elſe is able to do: He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt. We ſhall not need to ſtand long on this.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>We will grant Chriſt is able to ſuccour tempted ſouls: but is he willing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes, He is infinitly willing to ſuccour poor tempted ſouls. Our great ſuccour lies in <hi>Reconciliation with God the Father;</hi> as by comparing theſe two verſes together doth appear. God the father hath ſet him forth to be a <hi>propitiation:</hi> it was the will of God the Father, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould come and make propitiation, it was his will. Now, look into the 40. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and ſee what Chriſt ſaith concerning the will of the Father; verſe the 7. <hi>Loe, I come: in the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum of the book it is written of me: I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy Law is within my heart:</hi> Some books reade it, <hi>Thy Law is within my bowels:</hi> thy Law is within my heart, 'tis in my deſires. Yea, not only (ſaith he) in my deſires: but in the Goſpel we reade it, With deſiring have I deſired to eat this Paſs-over, before he ſuffered. <hi>Deſiring have I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> And (ſaith he) I have a <hi>baptiſme to be baptizeds with,</hi> and I am ſtraitened till it be accompliſh't: I can have no reſt till it be done, I am ſtraitened till it be accompliſhed. Yea, not only ſo: but (ſaith he) here in this <hi>Pſalm, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do thy will:</hi> 'tis the will of God he ſhould make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation; and ſo ſuccour: I delight to do thy will. And in the 8. of the <hi>Proverbs: My delights are with the ſons of men:</hi> ſome reade it, <hi>All my delight:</hi> but 'tis in the plural number. When God laid the foundations of the earth my <hi>delights</hi> were with the ſons of men. A high, and a great expreſſion. Surely, Jeſus Chriſt cannot but be willing to ſuccour tempted ones, when his delights are with the ſons of men.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>A man muſt needs be willing, to do that which he is willing to ſuffer much for, to be at much coſt and pains for. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:162405:77"/>was willing to build the Temple, becauſe he laid out ſo much by way of preparation. And <hi>Araunah</hi> was willing to have a ſacrifice, becauſe he gave up his threſhing-flowr, it appear'd he was willing. And now when Jeſus Chriſt is content to ſuffer ſo much that he may make a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſinners, and reconciliation with the Father, and ſo ſuccour; it argues that he is very willing.</p>
               <p>Beſides, <hi>A man is willing to have that done which he is much troubled for if it be not done.</hi> You know when Chriſt came to Jeruſalem, he wept (ſaies the text) and he wept: He came a ſuccouring, and they would not be ſuccoured: <hi>How often would I have gathered thee as an hen gathers her chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens under her wings, and thou wouldſt not?</hi> A Hen is a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring creature: Chriſt came a ſuccouring, came to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them as a Hen. A Hen ſits upon the eggs, and hatcheth with the warmth of her body: So doth Chriſt do with the warmth of his love. A Hen ſits till the feathers be off her own body, makes her own body naked for to hatch up: And ſo did Chriſt. When the chicken is hatch't, ſhe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours it, and covers it under her wings: and when the chicken can run abroad, let the hen find but a grain of corn, ſhe clucks, and cals the chicken to her to have part of it: And ſo did Chriſt. And when danger comes, the Kite comes, ſhe cals the chicken under her wings again to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour it: So does Chriſt. When he ſaies thus, he came to gather them as a Hen gathers her chickens under her wings, he came to ſuccour them, but they would not be ſuccour'd; ſee how he takes it: the text ſaies, <hi>He wept,</hi> he wept; he was much troubled. Wiſe men don't uſe to weep before company; children will: but thoſe that are very wiſe, if they will weep, they weep in private: Jeſus Chriſt (that was the wiſdom of the Father) fals a weeping, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not be ſuccour'd; Surely then, Jeſus Chriſt is very willing to ſuccour poor ſinners. And belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved! this was his love, and this was his compaſſion in the day of his infirmity; how great is it now in the day of his glory?</p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:162405:78"/>
               <p>Again, It argues that he is very willing to ſuccour poor tempted ſouls, <hi>becauſe he was ſo willing to cure diſeaſed bodies;</hi> when he was upon the earth he was willing to cure them: So willing, as though it did coſt a miracle, yet he would do it. So willing, that though they did not know him as he was, but thought him a Prophet, yet he would do it. So willing, as that though they did not deſire it themſelves but were brought by others, yet he would do it. So wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as that though they were unmannerly in their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him; withneſs the pulling the tyles off the houſe, yet he would do it. And that ſo willing, though much unbeleef expreſſ by thoſe that were brought unto him, yet he would do it. I beſeech you conſider it: this was a work that Chriſt came into the world to do; this is The work: the work that Chriſt came to do, it was <hi>to bind up broken hearts:</hi> The work that Chriſt came to do, was <hi>to open the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doors to poor captives: The Spirit of the Lord is upon me</hi> (you know the place.) <hi>To adminiſter a word in due ſeaſon to thoſe that are weak:</hi> He hath given me the tongue of the learned to adminiſter a word in due ſeaſon to thoſe that are weak. Now then, if Jeſus Chriſt was ſo willing to do the other work which was but his work by the bye, which was not <hi>The-work</hi> that he did come about: how infinitely willing muſt he needs be to do <hi>The-work</hi> that he did come about? but I ſay, to ſuccour poor tempted ones, this was <hi>The-work</hi> that he came upon; Heaven hath not alter'd him, he hath loſt none of his love by going thither: Surely therefore, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is infinitely willing to ſuccour poor tempted ſouls.</p>
               <p>Well, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>But though he be able, and willing, yet it may be he is not faithfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes, ſaith the former verſe, <hi>Faithful:</hi> merciful, and faithful High-Prieſt. <hi>Faithful in all his houſe as</hi> Moſes <hi>was.</hi> What honeſt man will break his word? go contrary to his oath? He is ſworne into this office of the High-Prieſt. Yea, we have not only his Promiſe, and his Oath, but the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Bond for the Sons performance: <hi>The ſeed of the woman
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:162405:78"/>ſhall break the ſerpents head:</hi> it ſhall bruiſe his heel, ſhe ſhall break his head. The pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand. This is the work that is in his hand, to ſuccour tempted ones: it ſhall proſper in his hand. In the 8. Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> We reade there at the 16. verſe, That he caſt out ſpirits with his Word, and healed all that were ſick: That is might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by <hi>Eſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> the Prophet, ſaying, <hi>Himſelf took our infirmities, and bare our ſickneſſes.</hi> Becauſe he took our infirmities, and bare our ſickneſſes, he took himſelf to be engaged for to heal the ſickneſſes, and diſeaſes among the people. Beloved! he hath taken our infirmities, He hath borne our ſins, and therefore he takes himſelf engaged alſo, for to heal our ſoul-diſeaſes, to heal thoſe temptations: He is very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>Well, But ſuppoſe he is faithful: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                  <hi>How doth he ſuccour thoſe that are tempted, in the day and time of their temptation?</hi> (that is the Fourth thing.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſuccours Before temptation: He ſuccours In temptation: He ſuccours After temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt ſuccours tempted ſouls Before the temptation comes; ſometimes:</hi> By a ſpecial manifeſtation of himſelf, ihs love, and fulneſs to them. When Chriſt himſelf was to be tempted, immediately before, the Father ſaid from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> And ſo, when Chriſt ſees that a ſoul is to go into temptation, he ſpeaks out from Heaven, and ſaies, <hi>This is my beloved ſervant in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes he ſuccours <hi>Before temptation;</hi> By laying in of Goſpel-principles, and Goſpel-diſpoſitions in the heart. <hi>The Law is weak,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle. As it is weak unto the point of Juſtification, the matter of Juſtification; ſo a legal diſpoſition is weak as to the matter of reſiſting temptation: a Goſpel-diſpoſition is able to bear it off. Chriſt fore-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a temptation, laies in ſuch a diſpoſition, &amp; then when it comes, Oh! ſaies the ſoul, How ſhall I be able to cloſe with all this love of the world, having received ſo many
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:162405:79"/>love-tokens from my dear Saviour.</p>
               <p>Again, He ſuccours <hi>Before the temptation: By filling the heart with the holy Ghoſt.</hi> When the veſſel is fild with one liquor, it keeps out another. I will return to my houſe (ſaith Satan) and I came and found it empty; and ſo he entered. The Lord therfore, fils the houſe, the ſoul with the holy Ghoſt, and ſo keeps Satan from entering.</p>
               <p>He ſuccours alſo, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder temptation:</hi> By opening the eyes of him that is tempted to ſee that 'tis but a temptation. <hi>A temptation is half cured, when a man knows that 'tis but a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi> when a mans eyes is open to ſee the tempter, and the temptation. Therefore men are ſo hardly cured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are hardly perſwaded that 'tis a temptation; when they ſee that, then they ſay, Get thee behinde me Satan. Chriſt opens their eyes.</p>
               <p>Again, He ſuccours <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder temptation:</hi> By letting fal ſome glimpſe of his love, ſome love-look upon a tempted ſoul. And ſo, when <hi>Peter</hi> was in the High-Prieſts hall, Chriſt looks upon him, and he went out and wept bitterly. It was the ſweet look of Chriſt, that made <hi>Peter</hi> weep bitterly; <hi>Peters tears, came from Chriſts eyes firſt:</hi> and though he were much engag'd, yet having a love-look from Chriſt, I'le ſtay no longer, and away he goes. And ſo, when a ſoul ſees but the gracious eye of Chriſt looking on him, he breaks off from his temptation: thus he ſuccours.</p>
               <p>Again, He ſuccours <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder temptation, by temptation, even from temptation.</hi> Beloved! <hi>the Devil ſeldom tempts with one ſingle temptation: As we ſeldom commit ſingle ſins, or receive ſingle mercies;</hi> ſo the Devil ſeldom tempts with a ſingle temptation. One may be laid in our Natures; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laid in our Callings: Chriſt ſees now, that one is given to Uncleanneſſe, or to Pride; and ſo he lets out Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan upon him, to trouble him with blaſphemous thoughts, and by the afflictions of thoſe blaſphemous thoughts, they are kept from Pride, and from Wantonneſſe, and deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in other ſins.</p>
               <p>He does ſuccour <hi>From temptation;</hi> I ſay, <hi>from temptation
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:162405:79"/>by temptation</hi> (ſometimes) <hi>by cauſing a word in the temptation to ſtandout, ſo as thereby to give the tempted man an hint to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So when Chriſt tempted, and tryed the woman of Canaan: 'Tis not lawful to caſt childrens bread before dogs: There ſtood out a word, that word <hi>Dog:</hi> ſhe laies hold on it, <hi>True Lord: yet the dogs eate of the crums.</hi> Chriſt does ſo order the very temptations of Satan, that ſome word or other in the very temptation does ſo ſtand forth as to hint the ſoule again unto Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he ſuccours <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder temptation: By throwing in a Promiſe, lotting the ſoul upon ſome Promiſe;</hi> which as a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, keeps the heart faſt in the time of a ſtorm.</p>
               <p>And ſometimes he ſuccours <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder temptation</hi> (again:) <hi>By weakending the temptation, and by keeping the heart, and the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation aſunder;</hi> may be, by raiſing up ſome <hi>Affliction:</hi> Woe to that ſoul, when the heart and temptation meet, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and temptation meet. The Lord Chriſt therefore, ſometimes is pleaſed to raiſe up an <hi>Affliction</hi> between them, that ſo theſe two wicked lovers may be kept aſunder. Thus Under temptation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After temptation</hi> he ſuccours: <hi>By filling the heart with joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi> By ſending the Angels to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: As when the Devil left Chriſt, had tempted him and left him; then came the Angels and Miniſtred to him. Every way, <hi>Before temptation:</hi> and <hi>In temptation:</hi> and <hi>After temptation,</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is aſuccouring Chriſt to tempted ſouls, he is a ſuccouring Chriſt: Beloved! <hi>he was aman of ſorrows, that he might be a God of ſuccours;</hi> his heart it is full of <hi>ſuccours.</hi>

(ſaies he) at the 5. verſe. <hi>Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble his word, and you that are caſt out by your brethren: As one whom his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Comforteth, ſo will I comfort you:</hi> you that lie and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before the promiſe, and dare not draw neer unto it, As a mother comforteth, ſo will I comfort you.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> He will not only ſuccour thus: but he will ſuccour poor tempted ſouls <hi>with a Notwithſtanding;</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their failings, Notwithſtanding all their infirmities. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a Type of Chriſt, his brethren ſold him away, he indured much miſery: Afterward his brethren came to want; and they go down to Egypt to him; and when they came there, <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſuccours them, Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all their former unkindneſſe; I am your brother <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> I am <hi>Joſeph</hi> your brother; 'tis true, you ſold me, and thus and thus you dealt by me; but you are come for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and I will ſuccour you with a Notwithſtanding. So ſaies the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; Poor tempted ſoul, I know how thou haſt dealt by me, how thou haſt ſold me, how thou haſt neglected me, how thou haſt crucified me: but I will ſuccour thee with a Notwithſtanding, Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all thy guilt, and all thy fear, I will ſuccour thee with a Notwithſtanding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Three great ſuccours that the Jewes had in the wilderneſs:</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour from the <hi>Rock,</hi> that gave out water: Succour againſt their Thirſt. Succour from the <hi>Mannah</hi> that came down from Heaven: ſuccour againſt their Hunger. Succour from the <hi>Braſen-ſerpent:</hi> from the fiery ſerpents that ſtung them. All theſe Three were great <hi>Types of Chriſt.</hi> And the <hi>Rock was Chriſt,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle. And ſaies Chriſt
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:162405:81"/>himſelf: <hi>I am the bread,</hi> (ſpeaking of the Mannah.) <hi>And when I am lifted up,</hi> (ſpeaking of the braſen-ſerpent, allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it.) Now, look into the ſtory and you will find; God did not give out theſe ſuccours to them till they murmur; in the 15. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> there they murmur, and murmur, and murmur, and then God opened the rock, and God gave them water notwithſtanding. And in the 16. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> there he gives them bread. And in the 17. there he opens the rock: but firſt they murmured; the Lord gave them theſe ſuccours with a <hi>Notwithſtanding.</hi> The thing that I mean is this: Will the Lord give them a <hi>Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Chriſt</hi> for their ſuccour, with a Notwithſtanding? and will he not give poor tempted ſouls <hi>the Real Chriſt</hi> with a Notwithſtanding, Notwithſtanding all if they do come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, if tempted ſouls do but come unto him? Oh! what a mighty incouragement is here unto all poor tempted ſouls to come unto Jeſus Chriſt? Oh! you, Come unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, you that never came unto Jeſus Chriſt, Come unto Jeſus Chriſt, you ſhall find him a ſuccouring Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If this Doctrine be true: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> what ground of ſtrong Conſolation is here unto all the Saints? Oh! you that are the ſervants of God, children of God; you that are Saints, will you ever doubt of Chriſts love again? will you ever ſuffer your hearts to lie under the preſſure of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent fears again? Doubting ariſes from Ignorance, miſtakes of Chriſt; we put <hi>Eſau's</hi> cloathes upon him; we make him an Angel of darkneſs and then we fear him. Ye don't look upon him as a ſuccouring Chriſt, and therefore you are ſo full of Doubtings: or if you do, you don't actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate your conſiderations, and you notions on him.</p>
                  <p>Beloved! Either there is a truth in this Doctrine; or elſe there is not. If there be not, what mean all the proofs that ye have had? And if there be a truth, if the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt be a ſuccouring Chriſt to tempted ſouls; why then ſhould you not triumph in him? and ſay, Well, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall ſeparate me from the love of God in Jeſus Chriſt:
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:162405:82"/>I am perſwaded, <hi>I am perſwaded, that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other ereature, ſhall be able to ſeparate me from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoned in the 8. of the <hi>Romans.</hi> And I pray mark it; <hi>Who then ſhall ſeparate us?</hi> (ſaies he at the 35. verſe) <hi>ſhall tribulation, or diſtreſſe, or perſecution, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, or nakedneſſe, or peril, or ſword? Nay in all theſe things we are more than conquerers, through him that loved us. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that neither death, nor life, &amp;c.</hi> Whence did ariſe this perſwaſion? (at the 33. verſe) <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that juſtifieth.</hi> (Mark) He does not ſay, 'Tis God that juſtifies me; but only in the general, 'Tis God that juſtifieth: <hi>Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died.</hi> He does not ſay, 'Tis Chriſt that died for me: but 'tis Chriſt that died.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> 
                     <hi>I, indeed, if I could ſay, That God juſtifies me; and Chriſt died for me; then I would ſay with</hi> Paul, <hi>That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall ſeparate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> raiſes his perſwaſion thus: <label type="milestone">

                     </label> 
                     <hi>'Tis God that juſtifies, and 'tis Chriſt that died.</hi>

                  <p>I but, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                     </label> was there any temptation, in any of all theſe that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks on?</p>
                  <p>Yes ſure: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> Why does he ſay elſe, <hi>That in all theſe things we are more than conquerers?</hi> There is an adverſary power in this. And what think you when he ſaies, <hi>That neither life, nor death, nor Angels, nor principalities, and powers?</hi> Does not the Devil come in there, under principalities and powers? Neither does he ſay thus: I'le hope well now, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt dies, and 'tis God that juſtifies; I'le hope well: No, but <hi>I am perſwaded, none of all theſe ſhall ſeparate me from the love of God in Chriſt.</hi> Though I have feared, I will fear no more. Thus he makes his Triumph. Oh! what ſtrong conſolation is here to all the Saints? You that are the tempted Saints of God, do not your hearts burn, and glow within you with love to Jeſus Chriſt? and will you queſtion his love to you? Did Chriſt Come and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:162405:82"/>ſuccour you? and will not you ſuccour your ſelves? Is his heart full of ſuccour toward you? and won't you own it? The Lord rebuke our unbelief.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If Jeſus Chriſt be a ſuccouring Chriſt: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>Then let us be ſuccouring Chriſtians.</hi> Shall the Lord Jeſus Chriſt take a poor tempted ſoul into his arms? and ſhall I thruſt him away with my hand? Shall the Lord Chriſt take him into his <hi>Boſome?</hi> and muſt I thruſt him out of the <hi>City,</hi> and the place where he dwels? Shall the Lord Jeſus Chriſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a poor tempted ſoul upon his ſhoulder, by way of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour? and ſhal I carry him upon my ſhoulder as a burden? It was Chriſt's Command: <hi>See that ye love one another, as I have loved you.</hi> And how did Chriſt love us? <hi>He loved us, and gave himſelf for us:</hi> He loved us, and was made in the form of a ſervant, took our Infirmities upon him: he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, and was tempted for us, ſuffered being tempted: And ſhall not I be willing to ſuccour thoſe that are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? You look upon another mans Opinion, or his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, or his froward diſpoſition, and you are offended at it whom otherwiſe you would love, and do account godly: But how do you know whether that be not his temptation? that his diſpoſition, and Opinion, and Practice; how do you know whether that be not his temptation that he lies under? and will you not ſuccour him? Oh! my beloved, How contrary are our diſpoſitions to Chriſts? Chriſt came from Heaven to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted: and we call for fire from Heaven againſt thoſe that are tempted. Chriſt would bear with much ſmoke, for a little fire: and we wil quench a great deal of fire becauſe of a little ſmoke. Oh! therefore, as you deſire to be like unto Jeſus Chriſt, ſuccour the Saints: and if there be any thing in their life that does offend you, ſay with your ſelves; I but, may be it is a temptaion that ſuch a man lies under; and Chriſt came to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted, why ſhould not I?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be a ſuccouring Chriſt? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                     <hi>Then why ſhould we yeeld unto our ſins, and to our temptations?</hi>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:162405:83"/>Though the Siege be ſtraight, and violent, and fierce, if a City be block't up, be beleaguer'd; if it have but hopes that ſuccour and relief will come, it will hold it out: and if it know for certain that ſuccour will come, it will hold out unto great extreamity. There's never a temptation but you are beleaguer'd by it: and when your temptation is about you, ſay, O my ſoul, be quiet, yeeld not; the Lord Chriſt is a ſuccouring Chriſt, and ſuccour will come, and therefore hold it out. Shall the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall he ſuccour me againſt my temptations with his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom? and ſhall I take my ſins, and temptations into mine own boſom? Shall he come to ſuccour me againſt my ſins? and ſhall I ſuccour my ſins that he comes againſt? What a mighty argument is here to keep us from all our ſins, and from yeelding to our temptations? Jeſus Chriſt is a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring Chriſt to tempted ſouls.</p>
                  <p>In the fift place, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> If there be a truth in this, <hi>Chriſt is a ſuccouring Chriſt:</hi> Let us all labour to anſwer Chriſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved! 'tis the duty, and the property of the people of God, to obſerve what God is doing upon their hearts, and to help on that work. If Jeſus Chriſt be ſuccouring of any of your ſouls, againſt your temptations; Oh! help it on, help on the work; 'tis your duty for to help it on, and to anſwer him.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                     </label> 
                     <hi>Chriſt ſuccours Before temptation; and he ſuccours <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder temptation; and he ſuccours After temptation: how ſhall I anſwer this? how ſhall I help his work on?</hi>

                     </label> and ſo I will winde up all. <hi>Does the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſuccour Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore temptation?</hi> Obſerve his ſuccours, and lay them up in your hearts againſt a rainy day: Gird your ſword upon your thigh, it may not be to ſeek when the enemy comes: have it in readineſſe. You don't lay the plaiſter on upon the wriſt for the Ague, when the Ague is on, but before it comes. Obſerve what thoſe tokens of love are that Jeſus Chriſt does throw into your boſom before a temptation comes, and lay them up carfully there.</p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:162405:83"/>
                  <p>And beloved in the Lord; <hi>Labour to keep the ſence of his love warm upon your hearts;</hi> Look as it is with water in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo with your hearts in this reſpect: So long as the fire is under the water, and the water is hot, it freezes not; but when the heat goes off, and the water is cold, then ice comes upon it. And ſo long as your heart is kept up in the ſence of Chriſts love, and warm with Chriſts love; ſo long the ice comes not, the temptation comes not. <hi>The ſlumber of grace, is a preparation to ſin, and a preparation to temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> When once our hearts grow cold, and grow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe; then way is made to temptation: and therefore, if you would anſwer Jeſus Chriſt; Oh! labour to keep the ſence of his love ſtill upon your hearts.</p>
                  <p>And when the temptation is come: <hi>Then look upon Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> No temptation ſo violent, or fierce, but a thought may ſteal out, and get a look upon Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>The ſight of Chriſt on the Croſs, is a Judge upon the Bench againſt all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> The conſideration of <hi>Three things, keeps one from the power of temptation. The worth of a ſoul: The hainouſneſs of ſin:</hi> And <hi>the love of Chriſt.</hi> And you ſee all theſe in Chriſt upon the Croſſe. When temptation comes, ſtand &amp; look upon him. You know, that when the Iſraelites were ſtung, they were then to look upon the <hi>braſen ſerpent,</hi> and by their very looking upon it, they were cured thereby. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is our <hi>braſen-ſerpent,</hi> lift up upon Goſpel poles, having more excellency than any braſen-ſerpent: That was but a piece of braſſe: he is the God of glory. That for a time: he is our High-Prieſt, and lives for ever. That for the Jewes only: but he for Jew and Gentile. That for thoſe that could ſee; and if any poor, blind man was ſtung, it was a caſe, what ſhould become of the blind man, how ſhould he look upon the braſen ſerpent? how ſhould he be cured; but this our braſen ſerpent, is able to give you an eye. Beloved! this Ordinance is ſtill on foot ſpiritually. And therefore Chriſt ſaies by the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Look unto me from all the ends of the earth, and be ſaved.</hi> Oh! when a temptation comes; poor tempted ſoul, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:162405:84"/>thy ſelf to the Lord Jeſus, ſtand wiſhly looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
                  <p>And then: <hi>Give thy ſoul over into the hands of Chriſt all thou canſt:</hi> put thy ſelf out of thine own hands. So long as the planck, or the board ſwims in the ſtream, in the midſt of the water, you may draw it along with a little thred: but if once it come towards the banck, towards the ſhoare, and touches upon the ground, then you can hardly draw it. So long as your temptation is in the ſtream of Chriſts love, and of his blood, you may draw it along the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily: but if once it come to touch upon your own ſhoare? Oh! then you draw hard. Whenſoever therefore, a temptation ariſes, go unto Jeſus Chriſt, and ſay, O Lord, I have no ſtrength to ſtand againſt this great Enemy: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it is my duty to reſiſt this temptation, but 'tis thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to ſuccour me under this temptation, and therefore I put my ſelf upon thee.</p>
                  <p>And then, <hi>reſt upon Chriſt.</hi> As I uſe to ſay, <hi>Your very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting on him makes him yours;</hi> your reſting on his ſtrength makes it yours; and your reſting on his ſuccour makes that yours.</p>
                  <p>And if the Lord command you to the uſe of any means; <hi>Don't reſt upon any becauſe they are great: Or deſpiſe any becauſe they are ſmall.</hi> You do obſerve, that the great Victories a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Jewes, they were obtained by the weakeſt means; and by the blowing of rams horns wals fell down. Thoſe were but Types of thoſe ſpiritual Victories under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God ſeldom does wound the head of a temptation, but firſt the heel</hi> (the means) <hi>is bruiſed whereby the head of the temptation is wounded.</hi> As Chriſts heel is bruiſed in his wounding of Satans head; So I ſay, 'tis in regard of means: ſeldome that any means does wound the head of a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the very heel of that means is firſt bruiſed: and therefore, don't deſpiſe it though it be ſmall.</p>
                  <p>And if it pleaſe the Lord, to caſt in any Promiſe, when you are under a temptation: Oh! take heed, <hi>that you don't
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:162405:84"/>live upon the letter of the Promiſe.</hi> I mean, don't live upon the Conveyance, but upon the Land: and yet how many do live upon the bare Promiſe, bare letter of the Promiſe. When a temptation comes, paſſe from the temptation unto the Promiſe; and through the Promiſe unto Jeſus Chriſt, and learn to live upon the thing Promiſed, and not the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>After temptation is over, (I can but touch on things) Either you have the better of Satan: Or elſe the worſe. If you have the worſe; Be for ever Humbled, but never Diſcouraged. And if you have the better of him: Then rejoyce in the Lord, and in all his goodneſs toward you, and in all his ſuccouring love and mercy. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord evermore, and again I ſay, rejoyce. As one whom his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comforteth, ſo will I comfort you:</hi> and then it follows, <hi>They ſhall rejoyce; your hearts ſhall rejoyce. But take heed your ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all joy after Victory, don't degenerate into carnal joy, and you be drunk therewith.</hi> 'Tis reported of the Engliſh, that once going into Spain, and taking in a Town there: after they had taken it in, there being much wine in the Town, the ſouldiers fell a drinking of themſelves drunk; and the Country came down upon them, and beat them out, and recovered the Town again. So 'tis with many: They have a Victory over temptation, and they begin to rejoyce ſpiritually; but their ſpiritual joy degenerates into carnal joy, and they are drunk with their joy, and ſo loſe their Victory. Beloved! <hi>Joy not in your Joy, but in the God of your Joy after Victory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if you have the better after temptation, if you have the better: be ſure of this, <hi>That you improve your Victory to more aſſurance.</hi> If the Devil get the better of you, he'le be ſure to improve his Victory to your deſpair: I ſay, if he get the better of you, he will be ſure to improve his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to your deſpair. Therefore, if you get the better of him be ſure that you improve your Victory, to more aſſurance of Gods love in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Yea, (my beloved) for ought I know, there is no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:162405:85"/>that a child of God meets withal, but he may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it to more aſſurance. As thus:</p>
                  <p>Surely, If I were the Devils own, he would never trouble me thus. When the ſtrong man keeps the houſe, all is at peace, and all is at quiet. Now ever ſince, from the very firſt day that I have ſet my face towards heaven, and Chriſt; Oh! how have I been troubled, and tempted, and perplexed, and vexed in my ſpirit? Surely therefore, I am none of the Devils. Now if I had been his own, I ſhould have been more quiet under him: but becauſe I am thus troubled. I hope in the Lord I am none of the Devils, I am the child of God. Thus a man may improve.</p>
                  <p>And, Oh! what a good thing were it, if we did make improvement of our temptations! what gracious improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might we make of all our temptations? and what a bleſſed iſſue might we have in our temptations, if we did go unto Chriſt for ſuccour.</p>
                  <p>I beſeech you therefore in the Lord, when as any temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ariſes, <hi>go unto Jeſus Chriſt, he is a ſuccouring Chriſt.</hi> He hath National ſuccours; and he hath Family ſuccours; and he hath Perſonal ſuccours: You have National temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; and you have Family temptations; and you have Perſonal temptations; Soul-temptations; temptations when you are alone. Therefore go unto Chriſt for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I beſeech you (beloved in the Lord) go to Chriſt and try him, put him to it: The greater your temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is, the more fit work for Chriſt to cure: do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, do not ſit down; go to Jeſus Chriſt, you ſhal find him better than I have ſpoken, you ſhall not find him worſe; he will go beyond my words, he will not fall ſhort of my words. As the Devill goes about like a roaring lyon, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king whom he may devour: So Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel, goes up and down with his ſuccour, ſeeking whom he may ſuccour. Go to him for ſuccour: and the God of peace, even Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, tread down Satan under our feet ſhortly.</p>

               <p>Here are two things: <hi>The Danger of the temptation;</hi> and <hi>the Remedy againſt</hi> it. The Danger in the 31. and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in the 32. verſe.

The holy Ghoſt is ſaid <hi>to enlighten a man:</hi> Satan is ſaid for <hi>to blind him, The god of this world hath blinded their eyes;</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle. The Spirit is ſaid to <hi>Rule in us;</hi> Satan is ſaid, <hi>To rule in the children of diſobedience.</hi> The holy Choſt is ſaid, <hi>To work in us mightily,</hi> the ſame word is uſed for Him alſo. The holy Ghoſt is ſaid, <hi>To fill the hearts of beleevers;</hi> They were <hi>filled with the holy Ghoſt:</hi> So are mens hearts ſaid, To be <hi>filled with Satan:</hi> Saies <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Ananias, why hath Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan filled thine heart?</hi> Indeed, there are three things eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, wherein he does fal ſhort: for though Satan is able to diſcern what temptations would take beſt with a man, yet he don't know mans thoughts, for God only is the knower of ones thoughts; that is Gods prerogative. And though Satan may work very effectually in the children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, yet notwithſtanding, he does not work with an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power. When the Lord converts a man, he puts forth an Almighty power in mans converſion. The ſame power (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, makes ye to beleeve. The Devil is Magnipotent</hi> (ſaies <hi>Luther</hi>) <hi>but not Omnipotent:</hi> the Devil may be very powerful, but he is not Almighty: neither does he put forht an Almighty power in his temptations, as God does in the converſion of a ſinner. And though he may ſuggeſt, and provoke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what is evil, he cannot force, or determine any man to evil. And therefore ſaies the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, why hath Satan filled thine beart?</hi> he asked <hi>Ananias</hi> that queſtion, becauſe Satan, though he did fill his heart, he could not have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, or determined him without his own will thereunto. But very powerful Satan is. In the 6. chapter to the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:162405:87"/>you ſhall ſee the Apoſtle ſpeaks thus much unto you there: at the 12. verſe. <hi>For we wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt principalities, againſt powers, againſt the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the darkneſs of this world, againſt ſpiritual wickdneſs in high places.</hi> He ſpeaks concerning Satan, as you ſee in the former verſe, <hi>Put on the whole armour of God, that you may be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the Devil, For we wreſtle not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fleſh and blood, &amp;c.</hi> It is ſomething for a man to have all the world againſt him, to have all man-kind againſt him: if all man-kind ſhould be aginſt one man, you would ſay, there were a great ſtrength; but behold more than that, here is ſomething more than fleſh and blood that every man does wreſtle againſt: <hi>For we wreſtle not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fleſh and blood:</hi> all man-kind is but fleſh and blood, and ſo ther's a weakneſs; but we wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood, <hi>but againſt principalities,</hi> for Authority; and againſt <hi>power,</hi> for Strength; and againſt the <hi>rulers of the darkneſs of this world,</hi> and againſt <hi>ſpiritual wickedneſs in high places.</hi> Oh! what a mighty power then hath Satan to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, moleſt, and to tempt the children of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether does Satan put forth this power,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>2</label> 
                  <hi>and exerciſe this his tempting power upon the Saints and Children of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> for they are the Saints that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of here, in that to the <hi>Epheſians; For we wreſile not againſt fleſh and blood.</hi> You that are Epheſians, and you that are Saints We wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood, <hi>but againſt principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and powers.</hi> Properly, ye don't wreſtle with a man that is down; ye wreſtle with a man for to throw him down; but he muſt be a ſtanding man that ye wreſtle withal: ye don't wreſtle with one that does run away but one that ſtands to it. Now all wicked men, they are down, but the Saints they ſtand, and they labour to throw Satan down, and Satan labours to lay them all along in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: but they properly do wreſtle with Satan, for they ſtand, the other are fallen already.</p>
               <p>Yea, the Saints are not only tempted by Satan; but the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:162405:88"/>beſt, and the moſt beloved Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt. In the old Teſtament: who more beloved than <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Job?</hi> yet they tempted. In the new Teſtament, who more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved than <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul?</hi> One of the Circumciſion, and the other of the Uncircumciſion and Apoſtleſhip, and yet both had ſpecial temptations.</p>
               <p>Yea, it is poſſible for one of Gods own children to be ſo far oppreſt with Satan, that he may even be weary of his life. In the 10. of <hi>Job,</hi> and the 1. verſe, ſaies <hi>Job</hi> under his great temptations: <hi>My ſoul is weary of my life.</hi> And if <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bekah</hi> were weary of her life, becauſe of the children of <hi>Heth:</hi> much more may a poor, gracious ſoul be weary of his life, by reaſon of theſe children of darkneſs, theſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of darkneſs, theſe temptations of Satan.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>Why ſhould Satan lie ſo heavy upon Gods own children and people? for he may know, that they ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved do he what he can: Satan had heard our Saviour Chriſt ſay to</hi> Peter, <hi>The gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt thee; and yet now Satan tempts: if Satan know this, why ſhould he follow Gods children, yea, the beſt of his children ſo ſorely with ſad temptations?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Satan is the envious man we reade of in Scripture; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> and when he hears the Lord owning and honouring of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then does his envy work and riſe: and when he hears any of Gods children triumphing by faith, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king boaſt of the love of God, then does his malice kindle into a flame; ſhall ſuch a one go to Heaven, and ſhall I be damn'd? (ſaies he) ſhall ſuch a one be received, and ſhall I be caſt away for ever? Theſe are the boylings of this envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mans heart againſt the children of the moſt high.</p>
               <p>But there is this great reaſon for it. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> Satan knows, that if he can but make Gods people, and the beſt of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren fall; though they ſhould not be damn'd, but pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that their fall ſhall be ſtumbling blocks unto others that may be damn'd. And therefore, I pray mark, how it is carried concerning <hi>Dauid:</hi> it is ſaid, in the 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. chapter, and the 1. verſe. <hi>That, Satan ſtood up againſt Iſrael
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:162405:88"/>to provoke</hi> David <hi>to number Iſrael.</hi> It is not ſaid thus, And Satan ſtood up againſt <hi>David,</hi> and provoked <hi>David</hi> to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Iſrael: no, but thus, And Satan ſood up againſt Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and provoked <hi>David</hi> to number the people: he ſtood up againſt Iſrael; why? becauſe he know, that if he did make <hi>David</hi> thus to number the people, it would be a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling for all Iſrael, and all Iſrael ſhould fare the worſe by it. When Satan ſtands up, and tempts the maſter of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily unto ſin, he does not barely ſtand up againſt him, but in tempting him, he ſtands up againſt all the family. When Satan tempts a religious holy man, a beloved Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Chriſt in a Town, Satan ſtands up againſt all the Town in tempting that one man. He ſtood up againſt Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and tempted <hi>David</hi> to number the people: and ſo when he tempts thoſe that are the moſt beloved Diſciples of Chriſt, he ſtands up againſt others; and therefore though Satan knows, that their ſins ſhall be pardoned, yet he does follow them with ſad and ſore temptations. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>3</label>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly: <hi>Satan</hi> loves to divide between friends: he is the great <hi>make-bait of the world,</hi> he loves to divide. He may know, that there is ſo much goodneſs between man and wife, that he ſhal never part them; and yet he will labour to ſow diſcord between them, that they may live uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably. And ſo, though he knows he ſhall never part Chriſt and a poor beleever; yet he will labour to throw jealouſies into the heart of a beleever concerning the love of Chriſt. He knew well enough what was ſaid concerning our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt: What was ſaid by the Angels at the birth of Chriſt; what was ſaid by the Angel to <hi>Mary;</hi> what was ſaid by <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> he heard what was ſaid from Heaven, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed:</hi> and yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he comes to Chriſt with an If: <hi>If thou be the Son of God:</hi> laboring to throw a jealouſy into the heart of Chriſt, and to doubt of his Son-ſhip, even with God the Father. So I ſay, although Satan ſhould know, that the Lord will pardon ſuch of ſuch a man, yet he loves to make a diviſion between God and the ſoul, and to caſt in jealuſies between</p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:162405:89"/>
               <p>Chriſt and a beleever. As for others (ſaies he) they are my own already, I ſhal not need to break into that houſe, there is nothing but chaffe lies there; but here's a godly man, and here's treaſure; and therefore he does eſpecially lay his battery againſt the Satines, and thoſe that are the moſt beloved Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay unto me, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>3</label> 
                  <hi>How does Satan come by this tempting power; this infeſting, and moleſting power?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great is the power (as we have read already) that he hath as he is a Superiour creature:<note place="margin">Auſw.</note> but Satan hath yet another power, and that is the power of Conqueſt; for in <hi>Adams</hi> fall, Satan conquered the whol world, all man-kind, they were the Devils conqueſt upon the fall. When a man is Converted, and trun'd to God, then he comes out of the kingdom of Satan. But I ſay, upon the fall the Devil made a conqueſt upon all man-kind, and ſo by conqueſt he hath a great power. Satan hath heave from God the Father to tempt; I don't ſay, that he hath a ſpecial leave for every temptation, not a ſpecial commiſſion, or permiſſion, or leave for every temptation; but there is no great, or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary temptation that does fall upon the children of God, but Satan hath a ſpecial leave from God the Father for it. There was a ſpecial temptation upon the Country, in his running their herd of ſwine into the Sea, and he had leave for that before he did it. There was a ſpecial temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon <hi>Ahab,</hi> in the lying ſpirit of the Prophets, and he had a ſpecial leave, and permiſſion from God for that. There was a ſpecial temptation upon <hi>Job,</hi> and he had a leave for that. Here was a ſpecial temptation coming down upon the Diſciples, and he had leave for that. Simon, Simon, <hi>Satan hath deſired you.</hi> He was fain to ask leave, and he had leave for that. There is no extraordinary, or great temptation befals any of the children of God, but Satan is fain to ask leave for it: he hath a leave for it, before he can come and tmept the ſoul.</p>
               <p>But you will ſa then unto me, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>4</label> 
                  <hi>Why does God the Father give Satan leave thus to tempt his own Children, and Chriſts own Diſciples?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:162405:89"/>
               <p>Firſt: take it thus, Lood whatſoever is the end, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> and the iſſue of any evil which befals the children of God, that was the deſign of God the Father, in ſuffering that evil to come upon them. Now the end, and iſſue of the Saints tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is alwaies good unto them; and therefore God ſuffers the temptations of his people, becauſe he hath a deſign of mercy, and love upon them in theſe temptations. What was the end, and iſſue of Satans tempting of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve?</hi> They fell and then the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life thereby was brought in: this was the end and the iſſue of it. Now God the Father had this deſign upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans temptation, all the while Satan was tempting of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi> and the Lord would never have ſuffered our heel to have been bruiſed by Satans temptation, but that he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to break the head of Satan. It was a great temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that of <hi>David,</hi> when as Satan ſtood up, and provoked him to number the people: pray, what was the end, and iſſue of that temptation? I ſhall only name the Scriptures: The 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> the 21. chapter: and the 22. chapter and the beginning of it, and the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> the 3. chapter, and 1. verſe, compared together, you ſhall find this: Firſt Satan tempts <hi>David;</hi> he numbers the people, the people being numbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, a plague breaks forth: the plague prevailing, <hi>David</hi> goes and offers up a ſacrifice at the threſhing flowre of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan; and there God told him the temple ſhould be built. <hi>David</hi> had a long time deſired to know where the Temple ſhould be built: he ſaies, he would give no reſt unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, no ſleep unto his eye-lids, until he had found out a place for God: you ſhall find, that <hi>David</hi> had this place diſcovered as the iſſue of this temptation, this was the iſſue of it, the Devil had as good have let <hi>David</hi> alone, he had as good have been quiet, for <hi>David</hi> now had the end &amp; the iſſue, attain'd unto that, that he never did attain unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. So I ſay it is with the people of God, the Lord ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffers his own children to fall into any ſin, but he does intend to wean them from that ſin that they do fall into, even by the falling into it: the Lord never ſuffers any of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:162405:90"/>his own children to be tempted, but he intends to break the back of that temptation, even by their being tempted. This is the deſign of God the father: Oh! what a glorious deſign of love, and mercy is here upon all the temptations of Gods people!</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> and higher deſigns: The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of his own Power; of his own Wiſdom; of his own Faithfulneſs; of his own Love and Free grace.</p>
               <p>The manifeſtation of his Power. When <hi>Paul</hi> was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and buffeted by Satan, the Lord ſaid unto him, <hi>That his ſirength ſhould be perfected in weakneſs:</hi> in <hi>Pauls</hi> weakneſs, Gods ſtrength ſhould be perfected.</p>
               <p>The manifeſtation of his Wiſdom, <hi>The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>The manifeſtation of his Faithfulneſs. In the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>The Lord is faithful, and will not ſuffer ye to be tempted above what ye are able to bear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The manifeſtation of his Free-love and grace. And therefore, when <hi>Paul</hi> was tempted and bufferted by Satan, and prayed againſt his temptation, the Lord anſwered thus: <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in regard of the Saints themſelves: How ſhould they give a Probate, or Teſtimony of their uprightneſs, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, their firm, and faſt cleaving to God, if they were never tempted: reade for this purpoſe, the 13. of <hi>Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and the 2. and 3. verſes. Before <hi>Job</hi> was tempted, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan thought that <hi>Job</hi> had ſerved God for a boone, for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: <hi>Haſt thou not ſeen my ſervant Job</hi> (ſaies God) I, ſaies Satan, but <hi>does Job ſerve God for naught? Job's</hi> an Hypocrite, all things go well with him, <hi>Job's</hi> in a fair, and bleſſed outward condition, and <hi>Job</hi> was never tempted; does <hi>Job</hi> ſerve God for naught? but now touch him, and let me tempt him a little, and ſee if he don't blaſpheme God then: thus Satan then. And juſt thus is the language of the Devil now: Does ſuch a man or woman ſerve God for naught? he is but an Hypocrite, all things go well with him, he was never yet tempted: but, O Lord, let this man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:162405:90"/>come under my hand, and let me tempt him a little, and ſee if he don't blaſpheme. Well Satan, (ſaies God) Job <hi>is in thine hand, only ſpare his lefe:</hi> And Satan did tempt him, and touch him: and in ſtead of blaſpheming, behold bleſſing; <hi>The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away; bleſſed be his Name:</hi> Here now <hi>Job</hi> gave a Teſtimony, that he did not ſerve God for ſomething, that his heart was ſincere and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. And ſo, when men can hold out, notwithſtanding all their temptations, they give a Teſtimony of their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, and ſincerity, and that their ſouls do cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in truth. For theſe, and many other reaſons, the Lord doth ſuffer his own beſt, and deareſt Children to be tempted by Satan.</p>
               <div type="application">
                  <head>I come to Application.</head>
                  <p>If God doth ſuffer his own people, and deareſt children,<note place="margin">Applica.</note> to be expoſed to Satans temptings and winnowings: Why ſould any man then doubt of his Child-ſhip, doubt of his own everlaſting condition, and ſay, That he is none of the child of God becauſe he is tempted? Beloved! I have ſeen a ſore evil under the ſun, a vanity even among the Saints, and people of God: Some doubting of the ſoundneſs of their condition, and the love of God, becauſe they are not tempted; others doubt betauſe they are tempted. One ſaies, Oh! I am afraid I am none of the child of God, for I was never tempted, the children of God, they meet with temptations, but I was never yet buffetted, and therefore I am none of Gods child: Another on the contrary; I labour under theſe and theſe temptations, and therefore I fear that I am none of Gods child: yea, ſometimes the ſame perſon thus: Firſt, he does not obſerve his own heart, and ſaies he, I fear I am none of Gods child, for I never was tempted. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, when he meets with temptation, then he doubts againe that he is not Gods Child becauſe he is tempted: Oh! what Childiſh dealing is this with God your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!</p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:162405:91"/>
                  <p>But my beloved in the Lord, If this be true, That the Lord doth ſuffer his own, and beſt children, to be expoſed to Satans winnowings, and temptings; then why ſhouldſt thou conclude that thou art not the child of God, becauſe thou art tempted? Oh! but, I don't conclude (will ſome ſay) that I am not the child of God, I don't conclude that the Lord does not love me becauſe I am tempted, but becauſe I meet with ſuch and ſuch temptations. Tell me, did not <hi>David, Job, Paul,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> meet with ſuch and ſuch, and ſo great temptations? Yea, did not Chriſt himſelf meet with it? Oh! but, my temptations are ſuch as would make ones haire ſtand upright on ones head to thinke of them; ſometimes tempted, even to lay violent hands upon my ſelf: What think ye of Chriſt? when Satan ſpake unto him, and tempted him to throw himſelf down off the pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Temple. Oh! but, I am tempted with ſuch temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that I am aſhamed to name, and my heart akes, and trembles when I do reflect on them, even with blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous thoughts. What think ye of Chriſt? was not he tempted to blaſphemy? Saies the Devil to him, <hi>All this will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me:</hi> what greater blaſphemy than to worſhip the Devil? to make a God of the Devil himſelf, what greater blaſphemy? Oh! but, I fear, and doubt my condition, and the love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, becauſe my temptations are not as the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods children, but my temptations are ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand with grace, there is a ſpot, that is not the ſpot of Gods people: and are there not temptations, that are not the temptations of Gods people? have not wicked men their peculiar temptations, ſuch as does not fall upon the children of God? I am afraid that my temptations are of that rank and of that ſort, and therefore I fear and doubt my condition. Mark I pray, This ſame word <hi>Temptation</hi> may be conſidered two waies: Either in regard of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallity, or form of the temptation; or in regard of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriallity, or matter of the temptation.</p>
                  <p>Take now Temptation according to the propriety of the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:162405:91"/>ſpeech and phraſe, and ſo wicked men are not ſaid to be tempted by Satan; by their own hearts they are, but I ſpeak of Satans temptations, properly the wicked are not ſaid to be tempted by Satan. He is ſaid to rule in them, in the children of diſobedience; and he is ſaid to lead them captive at his will: but if ye look into the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ye will not ordinarily find, that wicked men are ſaid to be tempted by Satan. A man does not tempt his wife, but when he ſolicites another woman, then he is ſaid for to tempt that woman. As the Sains are married to Chriſt, ſo wicked men, they are match't to Satan; and he is not in propriety of phraſe ſaid for to tempt them. Your men ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, thoſe that ſteal children, they don't tempt their own children for to go with them, they naturally go with their father: but they come and tempt your children, they are other folkes children that they tempt. And ſo Satan, he is properly ſaid to tempt thoſe that are none of his children. A Maſter don't tempt his ſervant, he is not ſaid properly to tempt his won ſervant to dwell with him, or to ſerve him; but he goes to another mans ſervant, and ſpeaks to him to come and dwell with him, and to ſerve him. As for wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, they are properly the ſervants of Satan; and therefore when the Devil ſolicites them to do that which is evill, or to dwell with him, and to converſe with him, 'tis not I ſay in propriety of ſpeech a proper temptation: but for the ſervants of Chriſt, when he ſolicites them unto evil, then he is properly ſaid to tempt them. This for the form of a temptation.</p>
                  <p>But now, take a temptation in the <hi>Materiality</hi> of it, for the Matter of it, which is a ſolicitation to evil; and ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men are tempted by Satan; yea, they are more temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than the godly are; that is, they are more ſolicited un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to evil by Satan; and the ſame temptation that godly men are tempted with, wicked men are tempted with: and the ſame temptation that wicked men are tempted with, a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man is tempted with. As there is no Duty which a godly man does performe, but a wicked man may do it,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:162405:92"/>for the Act, and yet remain wicked: So there is no ſin, which a wicked man fals into, but a godly man may be tempted to it and yet remain godly.</p>

                     <hi>This evil that is upon my heart, is not the temptation of Satan, but indeed it is the corruption of mine own heart, and therefore I fear my condition. Indeed, if I were ſure that it were only the temptation of Satan, I ſhould never que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion Gods love, nor mine own condition becauſe of it; but, Oh! I am afraid it is not a temptation of Satan, but the corruption of mine own heart, and therefore I fear all is not right with me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is no new thing, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> for Gods own people and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to charge all Satans temptations upon their own hearts, to lay all at their own door. Wicked men, they charge all their own corruptions upon Satans temptations, as if they were not their own, but altogether Satans: God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, they charge all Satans temptations upon their own hearts, and upon their own account, as if they were, all their own and nothing of Satans; this is no new thing. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> when they were fallen, and had eaten the forbidden fruit, then they were ungodly, in the ſtate of nature preſently upon the fall before they beleeved in Chriſt: and, ſaies <hi>Eve, This ſerpent gave me to eat;</hi> as if ſhe ſhould ſay, He hath done it, 'tis all his work, 'tis Satans work, and 'tis none of mine; being in her unregenerate ſtate, ſhe laies all upon the Devil, and free's her ſelf, as if ſhe had nothing to do with it. On the other ſide, <hi>David</hi> was provoked by Satan to number the people; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, ſee what he ſaies in the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. Chapter and the 10. verſe. And <hi>Davids</hi> heart ſmote him after that he had numbered the people; and <hi>David</hi> ſaid unto the Lord, <hi>I have ſinned greatly in that I have done; and now I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, O Lord, take away the iniquity of thy ſervant, for I have done very fooliſhly.</hi> He laies it all upon himſelf: he does not go now and ſay, Satan hath provoked me to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the people, and 'tis Satans work and none of mine; but he does charge it here upon himſelf, as if Satan had no
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:162405:92"/>hand at all in it. I have done fooliſhly (ſaies he) and I have ſinned, and forgive this great iniquity. This is uſual; <hi>Wicked men excuſe their own corruptions, by Satans temptations: Godly men aggravate Satans temptations by their own corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in the Second place: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> Although this be ſo, that it is uſual with the Saints thus to do, to charge all upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and nothing on Satan; yet know, that the Saints ſeldom or never do fall into any great ſin, but Satan hath a ſpecial hand therein. I am not of <hi>Origens</hi> mind, to lay all ſin upon Satan, not upon man; but I ſay, there is no great ſin that any of Gods children do fall into, but Satan hath a ſpecial hand and a work therein. And therfore if ye look into the New-Teſtament, you wil find, That the ſins of the godly, they are very often called Temptations: in the 1 of <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. Chap. and the 13. verſe. <hi>There hath no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation taken you, but ſuch as is common to man; but God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that which you are able, but will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape. Wherefore</hi> (at the 14. verſe) <hi>my dearly beloved, fly from Idolatry,</hi> as if that were temptation too. And ſo in that 6. of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi> 1. verſ. <hi>If any man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are ſpiritual reſtore ſuch a one in the ſpirit of meekneſs, conſidering thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted:</hi> leſt thou alſo fall into ſin. And ſo the Apoſtle ſaies unto the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> in the 1 of <hi>Theſſa.</hi> 3. chap. and the 5. verſ. <hi>For this cauſe, when I could no longer forbear, I ſent to know your faith, leſt by ſome means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.</hi> The meaning is, Leſt you are fallen; but 'tis called temptation to them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Although this be true, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>3</label> That there is no great ſin that the Saints do fall into, but Satan hath a ſpeciall hand in it: Yet it is the property and diſpoſition of Gods people to be humbled and grieved under their temptations as if they were all their own and nothing of Satans. <hi>Peter</hi> goes out and weeps bitterly when he had fallen; He might have ſaid thus: The Lord told me that there was a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:162405:93"/>coming, Satan had deſired to winnow me; and now the word of the Lord is fulfilled, Satan hath tempted me, and I am thus fallen: But not a word of Satan, but he goes out and weeps bitterly, as if it were all his own work. And let me tell you for your comfort, When as you can mourn over your temptations, as if they were all your own, and nothing of Satans, the Lord will pardon them to you, as if they were all Satans, and nothing of your own.</p>
                  <p>In the Fourth place, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>4</label> to ſpeak a little of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe that ye may know the difference between the temptations of Satan, and the corruptions of your own heart.</p>
                  <p>When as your heart, and your fleſh trembles and quakes under the firſt riſing, and motion of a ſin, this is not your own corruption alone, but there is a temptation with it. When the corruptions of ones own heart does work up evil, a mans heart is rather pleaſed and tickled with it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to it, then any way ones fleſh lie trembling, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king under it. That temptation is not much to be feared, when a man fears himſelf for his temptation. He is to be feared moſt, that does fear leaſt: and he is to be feared leaſt, that does fear moſt. A godly, gracious, man or woman, is humbled under nothing more than under his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; he looks upon his temptations as the greateſt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in all the world. As now, take that of Blaſphemous Thoughts; Suppoſe a poor ſoul troubled with ſuch evill thoughts, ſuch a poor ſoul ſaies, I do profeſſe it in the ſight of God, I never met with ſuch an affliction ſince I was born: I have loſt Children; Oh! but that affliction is not like to this: I have loſt friends; Oh! but that affliction is not like to this: I have loſt my Eſtate; Oh! but that affliction is not like to this. Man or woman, if it be thy affliction, 'tis not thy ſin. And I appeal to you now, you that ſay, ye don't doubt of Gods love, ye don't fear your own condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion becauſe of temptations only, but becauſe ye are afraid they are the corruptions of your own heart, and not the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:162405:93"/>temptations of Satan; I appeal to you that ſay ſo; Are ye not afraid in your ſelves becauſe of your temptations? Don't ye look upon your temptations as your greateſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions? Nay, does not thy fleſh quake, and tremble ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when a temptation daſhes, and beats in upon thy ſoul? does not thy very outward man, ſometimes, lie qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and trembling, before a temptation? Certainly, this is not all the corruption of thine own heart, here's the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils hand, here's a temptation in it, and, poor ſoul, thou maieſt have ſome comfort yet; notwithſtanding the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ſo great, yet here is comfort, 'tis no other but what may ſtand with grace.</p>
                  <p>Oh! but you will ſay: <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>Suppoſe it be all the temptation of Satan, and not the corruption of mine own heart, yet 'tis a great affliction, and what comfort can I have in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>

                  <p>What comfort! Is it not much comfort to know, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> that there is nothing does befal you, but what may befall a true child of God? Sometimes ye ſay thus: No mans conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is like to mine; did I but know that it is ſo with other of Gods children, then I ſhould be ſatisfied: This Doctrine tels thee, That Chriſts own beſt Diſciples, ſometimes, are expoſed to Satans temptings, to Satans winnowings.</p>
                  <p>Is it not a great comfort, for a man to know, that while he is tempted, Chriſt is at prayer for him? <hi>But I have pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed for thee.</hi> In time of temptation you cannot pray, I but Chriſt can pray, and he is then at prayer for you: as he ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> ſo he ſaies to every Diſciple of his now, But I have prayed for thee: poor ſoul, though thou canſt not pray thy ſelf, yet I have prayed for thee.</p>
                  <p>Is it not a ſweet comfort, for a man to know, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy is overcome before he ſtrikes? Satans temptation is overcome by Chriſts Interceſſion; and Chriſt prayes before Satan tempts; <hi>But I have prayed for thee:</hi> before the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation came.</p>
                  <p>Is it not a choice comfort, for a man to know, that Satan
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:162405:94"/>the great tempter, hath no more power than my father gives him leave? Thus it is, Satan hath deſired &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Is it not wonderful comfort, for a man to know, that there is ſomething that he can never be robbed of? When a man is travelling in his journey,; if he meet with theeves, they take away the money that he hath about him; but when they have taken away all his money that he hath about him, well (ſaies he) though they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away my ſpending-money, and that which I did wear about me, yet I have land at home that they cannot rob me of. And ſo ſaies a child of God (or at leaſt he may ſay ſo) when Satan comes and tempts him, and robs him of ſome comfort; yet bleſſed be the Lord, I have Union with Chriſt that I can never be robbed of; and I have an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in Heaven that theeves cannot break through and ſteal away. Satan may take away my ſpending-money, my ſpending comforts that I have here in this world; but Oh! bleſſed be God, I have ſuch comforts, and ſuch an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, ſuch durable riches that I can never be robbed of Oh! you that are the Saints and people of God, lift up your heads: you that have been bowed under temptation, theſe things have I ſpoken to you, that you may not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with temptation, you that are tempted, but that in the midſt of all you may breath out your ſouls in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Well, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> but yet you will ſay, <hi>It is not comfort that I look for, or that I follow after; but the truth is, I am ſorely tempted, and Satan lies heavy on me, following, and dogging me at the heels to yeeld unto his temptations; what ſhall I ſay, or what ſhall I do, that I may not yeeld unto his temptations?</hi>
                  </p>

                     </label> If it be poſſible, don't ſtand to treat with Satan, don't ſtand to parley with him; he will diſpute you out of all your comfort if you ſtand and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley with him. You have half loſt the field when ye honour Satan, and you honour him when you follow him into his diſputes: if it be poſſible therefore don't ſtand and parley, or diſpute with Satan, but if you muſt ſay ſomething to

Satan is a great lyar, and he is your Enemy, and therefore when he ſaies unto thee, There is no hope for thee, thou haſt been a great ſinner, a Drunkard for thus many yeers, a Swearer thus many yeers, there's no hope for thee: ſay, Satan, therefore I beleeve the contrary, there is hope for me, becauſe thou ſaieſt there is none, for thou art a lyar, yea, the father of lyes.</p>
                  <p>Again, If ye muſt ſpeak with Satan; then ſpeak of Chriſt, of grace, of the infinite love of God in Chriſt: he cannot ſtand before words of grace, and before words of love: not a word of grace, or of free love in all his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
                  <p>Yea, If you muſt ſpeak with Satan, tell him, Oh! tell him, what ye find in the waies of God, and tell him, that you beleeve beyond what ye find; thus: Satan, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I find nothing but ſweetneſs in the waies of God; thou toldſt me that if I would turn godly I ſhould never have merry day again, but I tell thee what I now find, I find of a truth, <hi>That the ſowreſt part of godlineſs, is ſweeter than the ſweeteſt part of wickedneſs.</hi> Satan, I find, that all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou toldſt me is falſe; Thou ſaidſt, I ſhould loſe all my friends: I have better. Thou ſaidſt, I ſhould loſe all my comforts if I turned godly; I have better, Satan. And this I find, Satan; That all that ever Chriſt ſpake unto me, is true: Oh! I find infinite ſweetneſs in the waies of God, and I beleeve beyond what I find: that if the wheels of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſhould run never ſo croſſe, yet through grace I would beleeve.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> If ye would prevent temptation: <hi>Then labour to get your hearts mortified unto the objects of love and fear.</hi> Satan tempts two waies: As a Serpent: And as a Lyon. When Satan tempts as a Serpent; then he does make a tender, and an offer of ſome comfortable, profitable, ſweet thing: You ſhall be like God; <hi>You ſhall be as God,</hi> ſaies he unto <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> when he tempted as a Serpent, came as a Serpent. And ſo dealing as a Serpent with our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>All this will I give thee if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> Shews him the glory of the world, and all this will I give thee. So ſaies he unto a poor ſoul, when he tempts as a Serpent, Come and yeeld unto this temptation, and all this comfort will I give thee, and all this profit will I give thee, and all this repute and honor will I give thee. Thus as a Serpent. Sometimes he tempts as a Lyon: for he goes up and down as a <hi>roaring Lyon,</hi> ſeeking whom he may devour. And when Satan tempts as a Lyon, then he does roare upon a poor ſoul, and labours to ſcare him out
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:162405:95"/>of his conſcience, and out of the good waies of God. And therefore in the book of the <hi>Revelation, Satan ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon.</hi> Satan ſhall do it. And ſometimes he does ſtand and rattle the chaines of a priſon; Look, do ye hear theſe? If you will go on in ſuch and ſuch a way, you wil loſe al your friends; &amp; if you will go on in ſuch a way, I wil make it too hot for you, and thus and thus ſhall you ſuffer, and it ſhall coſt ye a priſon ere I have done with you. Thus now Satan tempts as a Lyon, by holding terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble objects before a man. It is ſaid, That Satan came to our Saviour Chriſt, and he found nothing in him; ſo he prevailed not: But Satan comes to us, and he finds a great deal in us, he finds a diſpoſition in us to be moved with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of love, unto comfortable, and profitable things: He comes to us, and finds in us a diſpoſition to be moved with Fear by terrible objects. Wherefore now (my beloved) do you deſire to prevent the miſchief of a temptation? Oh! labour more and more to die unto all the objects of your outward Love, and the objects of Fear; Die to the objects of Love, get your heart mortified to theſe two objects of Love and Fear. And be ſure of this, if thou wouldſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent temptation, that ye labour more and more to walk in the light: Satan is the prince of darkneſs, and he walks in darkneſs: and he tempts in darkneſs. <hi>When night comes the beaſts go forth to their prey,</hi> ſaies the Pſalmiſt, And when Satan ſees a poor ignorant ſoul, that walks in the dark, ſaies he, Here's a fit prey for me. Oh! therefore, you that are ignorant, and have ſate ignorant under the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for the Lords ſake, labour to get more light, and more knowledge, get your heart opened unto every truth of God, labour to acquaint your ſelves more with Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and ſet your boſomes open unto every truth of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>And, beloved! whether you would overcome, or wha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you would prevent temptation; what ever means you uſe; be ſure of this, <hi>That you take your temptation and dip it in the blood of Chriſt.</hi> Take a candle, that is lighted, and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:162405:96"/>only blow out the candle, the candle is eaſily lighted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: but when the candle is out, take it and put it into the water, and then 'tis not ſo eaſily lighted again: So now a temptation comes, and you blow it out with a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and you won't yeeld to it, alas, 'tis eaſily lighted again: but now, take this candle, take this temptation, and come and dip it in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and it will not be ſo eaſily lighted again; ſo you ſhall be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent temptation for the time to come: <hi>Never reſt alone in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving, but, Oh! take your temptation and dip it in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if that you do overcome your temptation at any time; be thankful to God: if ye have more than fleſh and blood againſt you, ye ſhall have more then fleſh and blood with you. And therefore, have you overcome temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? go away and be very thankful, and ſay, Oh! though fleſh and blood be againſt me, yet I have more than fleſh and blood with me, praiſe the Lord much: And if you have been overcome with temptation, yet be not diſcouraged; for ye hear the Doctrine, God doth ſuffer his own dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be tempted, to be buffeted, to be expoſed to Satans temptings, and to Satans winnowings. But though ye be tempted, and it be a temptation of Satan, yet ye hear withall, That 'tis the property, and diſpoſition of Gods own people to grieve, and mourn under their temptation as if it were all their own, and nothing of Satans. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now (my beloved) having heard theſe things, think on them, and the Lord bleſſe them to you every day more and more.</p>

The word ſignifies alſo, a <hi>total defect,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Judas</hi> made, who of a Diſciple became an Enemy, a Traitour; and in ſtead of beleeving, fell to deſpair: and ſo <hi>Peters</hi> faith did not faile. A mans faith is ſaid to faile, Either when it fals ſhort of what it hath been, or what it ſhould be; and in both theſe reſpects <hi>Peters</hi> faith did fail: It fell ſhort of what it had been, it fell ſhort of what it ſhould be. But there is a Two fold failing in faith: One in regard of the Acting and Exerciſe of faith; and another in regard of the grace of faith it ſelf. In regard of the Acting, Working, and Exerciſe of faith, <hi>Peters</hi> faith did fail: but in regard of the grace it ſelf, ſo it failed not. The <hi>Lutherans,</hi> they ſay and contend much for it, That a regenerate mans faith
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:162405:97"/>may fail totally, and finally in time of temptation: and ſo they ſay, that <hi>Peters</hi> faith failed here, when he denied his Lord and Maſter; becauſe it is ſaid in the next words, <hi>When thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi> As if his faith had failed ſo far, as he ſhould need a new converſion.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi> thus: I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not: and do thou ſtrengthen thy brethren <hi>again:</hi> do thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to that work again. And ſo you have the ſame word uſed in the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> tranſlated in the 58. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> at the 6. verſe. <hi>Wilt thou not revive us again?</hi> The word in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew is thus: Wilt thou not <hi>convert,</hi> or <hi>turn unto us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive us?</hi> which we tranſlate, Wilt thou not revive us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? And ſo the words here may be tranſlated, (being an Hebraiſme) But do thou ſtrengthen thy brethren <hi>again.</hi> But ſuppoſe that the words ſtand according to their preſent tranſlation, it does not argue, that <hi>Peter</hi> did fail totally in this temptation: for, the whole life of a Chriſtian here, is a continual converting, and turning to God: We repent, and repent again; turn, and we turn again. Every day we turn unto God yet more and more; every day brings forth another converſion: yet not ſo, as if the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion were made void. And if the faith of a beleever would fail totally in the time of a temptation; what ſhould be the meaning of thoſe words, in the 1. of <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. Chapter, and the 18. verſe. We know, that <hi>whoſoever is born of God ſins not;</hi> but <hi>he that is begotten of God, keepeth himſelf, and that wicked one toucheth him not:</hi> The wicked one: that is <hi>Satan,</hi> he toucheth him not. But now, if Satan could tempt a godly man, and prevail ſo far in his temptation, as to make his faith fail totally, then he would touch him to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: but (ſaies the text) he keeps himſelf, and the wicked one toucheth him not: and therefore his faith cannot fail totally, a regenerate mans faith cannot fail totally. And ye know what is ſaid, in that 7. of <hi>Matthew</hi> at the 24. and 25. verſes. <hi>Whoſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:162405:98"/>them, I will liken him unto a wiſe man, which hath built his houſe upon a rock; and the rain deſcended, and the flouds came, and the winds blew and beat upon that houſe; and it fell not, becauſe it was founded upon a rock.</hi> Now every Beleever is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a rock, <hi>(Chriſt)</hi> and therefore, though the rain deſcend, and the flouds come, and the winds blow, and temptations be never ſo great, he cannot fail totally, becauſe he is built upon a rock. In the 13. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> ye know it is made the property of the falſe ground, that in the time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it fell away: Now if the good ground (a regenerate man) ſhould fall away in the time of temptation; what difference were there between the falſe ground, &amp; the good ground? Plainly therefore, the Scripture holds forth this truth unto us, That a regenerate man, a Beleever, though his faith may fail much, yet it does not fail totally in time of temptation. And thus <hi>Peters</hi> faith failed, and thus it failed not: In regard of the Exerciſe, and Acting of his faith, it did fail; but in regard of the grace it ſelf, faith it ſelf, ſo it failed not: and ſo it is, and may be with others of the Saints alſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>2</label> 
                  <hi>If the faith of a beleever do only fail in regard of the Acting, Exerciſe, and Working thereof, What great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience is there, or evil in the failing of his faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much, (my beloved) very much: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> For though that faith fail only in regard of the Acting, Exerciſe, and working, he does loſe an opportunity of glorifying God. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Abraham, That he beleeved, and gave glory to God.</hi> Faith gives glory to God: it glorifies his Power, his Mercy, his Faithfulneſs, and his Wiſdom; not faith in the Habit, but faith in the Exerciſe of it glorifies God: and ſo much as a mans faith doth fail, in the Acting, Working, and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it, ſo much he loſeth an opportunity of glorifying God.</p>
               <p>Moreover, He loſes his own Comfort. Faith is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting grace. <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God.</hi> And in the 15. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the 13. verſe, ye find, That Joy and Peace grows upon faith: <hi>Now the God of hope,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:162405:98"/>fill ye with all Joy and Peace in beleeving.</hi> So much as a man does beleeve, ſo much Joy and Peace: if a man fail in the Exerciſe of his faith, he does loſe his Comfort.</p>
               <p>Yea, hereby alſo, <hi>he does loſe his preſent prize.</hi> A Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath a prize in this life; he hath a two-fold crown: A crown of glory in the world to come; and a preſent crown. And therefore ſaies the Lord unto the Church of <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, Hold faſt that which thou haſt, leſt another take thy crown.</hi> Now if a man do fail in the Exerciſe of his faith, he does loſe much of his preſent prize. Ye know how it was with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aron,</hi> ye reade of it in the 20. chapter of <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> and the 12. verſe. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>Becauſe ye beleeve me not, to ſanctifie me in the eyes of the children of Iſrael; therefore ye ſhall not bring this congregation into the land which I have promiſed them.</hi> They were ſhut out of the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for not beleeving. But <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Araon</hi> did not loſe the grace of faith, it was only failing in the Exerciſe of faith; their failing was not in the grace it ſelf, but only they failed, in the Exerciſe of their faith, and they were ſhut out of <hi>Canaan</hi> for it. And <hi>Moſes</hi> beſought the Lord earneſtly in prayer, that he would reverſe this threatning, and it might not be; he was ſhut out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> meerly for failing in the Exerciſe of his faith. Oh! what an evil thing is it then, for a Chriſtian to fail in his faith, though it be no more than in the Exerciſe of his faith.</p>
               <p>Further, In this failing of ones faith, though but in the Exerciſe of it; <hi>A Chriſtian does loſe much of the benefit, and ſweetneſs of the mercy promiſed.</hi> Look as it is with a wicked man, in regard of the judgment threatned; So with a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man in regard of the mercy promiſed. Now take a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, and let the threatning of God be fulfilled before him upon others, upon himſelf; he profits not by Gods judgments. Why? becauſe that he don't exerciſe faith concerning the threatning; and ſo when the judgment comes, he profits not by Gods dealing, by Gods judgments, he loſes the benefit of Gods diſpenſations that way. So I ſay with a godly man: let the promiſe be fulfilled, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:162405:99"/>he does not find the ſweetneſs, or the benefit of the mercy promiſed when the promiſe is fulfilled: Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he don't exerciſe faith in the promiſe it ſelf. When as the Lord gave Manna, <hi>Moſes</hi> had the ſeetneſs of it, why? becauſe he exerciſed faith about it: But the children of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, they make a tuſh of it, a light matter of it: why? becauſe they look't upon it in a way of ſence, &amp; did not take it in a way of beleeving, and ſo they loſt the benefit, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the mercy promiſed. Beloved! it is no ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, for to loſe the benefit, and ſweetneſſe of the mercy promiſed: that a Chriſtian loſes by failing in his faith in regard of the Exerciſe of it; and therefore certainly it is a very evil thing: though their faith fail not in regard of the grace it ſelf, yet if it fail in regard of the work, and the exerciſe of it, it is a very evil thing, and much incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience comes unto the Saints thereby.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>3</label> 
                  <hi>Whereby may it appear, that Satans great deſign is upon our faith in the time of temptation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He does tempt moſt unto that ſin which is the greateſi:</hi> and the ſin againſt the Goſpel is the greateſt ſin. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> Satans great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is, to hinder the work of Chriſt, the kingdom of Chriſt in the hearts of the Saint; to counter-work the Spirit of God. Satan does tempt that he may tempt: and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt temptation uſually comes in the reare, comes at the laſt. Satan does tempt a man to break the Law; but he hath a further reach in that: for he tempts a man to break the Law, that ſo he may tempt him afterwards to ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Goſpel: he lies in ambuſh in one temptation, for to draw to another. When Satan tempted our firſt parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> he tempted like a ſerpent, in form of a ſerpent: and ſo now too, he comes, and he winds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us in his temptation; but his ſting is in the taile, and at the latter end. And thus ye ſee it was in the temptation of our Saviour Chriſt: his great deſign was upon Chriſts faith: in the 4. of <hi>mathhew,</hi> ye know he hath Three temptations there: and ſaies he, in the two firſt temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>If thou be the Son of God?</hi> and <hi>If thou be the Son of God?</hi>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:162405:99"/>And in the Laſt temptation: <hi>All this will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> He tempted him to <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſme;</hi> and what greater unbeleef? So 'tis with the Saints alſo: Satan, he comes and tempts them to ſowre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, frowardneſſe, and paſſion in their families, but he hath a further reach upon that diſtemper: for (ſaies he) I will tempt this man or woman to paſſion, and froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and when he hath been froward, and paſſionate, then I will tempt him to be doubting whether he be the child of God or no: firſt I wil tempt this man for to break the Law, and when he hath broken the Law, then will Itempt him to ſin againſt the Goſpel, then will I ſtrike at his faith: his great deſign ſtill is upon your faith in all his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>Why is Satans great deſign upon our faith in time of temptation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is the great Robber, or Theef: and if he can, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> he will be ſure to ſpoil a man of that wich is the beſt. Now faith is more precious than gold; the trial of your faith is, faith is the gift of God: and therefore, if he can get any thing from a man, he will get that which is Gods gift. He is the great hinderer of all good, of every good work; and he will eſpecially labour to hinder that work which is <hi>The</hi> work of God in a ſpecial manner: and this is THE <hi>Work of God, that ye beleeve in his Son.</hi> Satan knows, that faith is the moſt Beneficial grace unto the Saints: The <hi>Shield</hi> of faith, it is called; and the <hi>Anchor</hi> of faith. If ye be in a ſtorm at ſea; faith is your Anchor: If ye be in danger at land, before Enemies, faith is your Shield. If that a mans Faith fail, his Duties fail, his heart failes, and all failes. He knows well enough, that he ſhall ſoon make us ſuffer ſhipwrack, if he can but weaken faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his great deſign is upon our faith. He knows, that faith is moſt prejudicial to Himſelf: for <hi>by faith we overcome the world; whom reſiſt, ſtedfaſt in the faith; And</hi> by <hi>faith we quench the fiery darts of the Devil.</hi> Now then (ſaies Satan) Does faith quench my fiery darts? then will I labour to
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:162405:100"/>quench faith if I can. The Devil does labour alwaies to preſent himſelfe in Chriſts cloathes unto a ſoul, as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light: and he does labout to rpeſent Chriſt in his own cloathes, as an Angel of darkneſs. When as he is a lyar Himſelf, he does labour to make the ſoul put the lye upon Chriſt, and upon the Spirit. The Spirit of God, that comes and teſtifies unto a man or woman, Thou art the child of God: Satan ſaies, No. When a man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore does ſay, He is not the child of God; the language of his action is, He gives the lye unto the Spirit, and he ſaies, that Satan ſpeaks true: So here he makes Chriſt and the Spirit of Chrhiſt a lyar by his unbelief; &amp; he makes the devil to ſpeak true. Now this is Satans great deſign, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in all his temptations, ſtill he ſtrikes at the faith of the Saints, labours to weaken their faith; his great deſign is upon their faith.</p>

                  </label> Satan does ſometimes labour to weaken our faith, By drawing us from the means of faith. Take the wood away from the fire, it will ſoon loſe it's heat, if not put out. And if a man be but drawn away from the means of faith; the means drawn from him, or he from the means by his own default, his faith will be ſoon wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened. This Satan labours to do ſometimes.</p>
               <p>Sometimes again, He raiſes up Mountains of Difficulties, and Diſcouragements in the way of a Chriſtians obedience; and ſo labours to wound his faith. Throw water upon the fire it will ſoon be out.</p>
               <p>But that I may ſpeak the more fully unto this great Queſtion, the anſwer whereof is of concernment every day amongſt you.</p>
               <p>Ye know there the Three acts of faith: There is the faith of <hi>Reliance;</hi> whereby a ſoul does relye upon God in Chriſt. There is the faith of <hi>Aſſurance;</hi> Whereby a man is perſwaded of Gods love towards him, and his love to God,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:162405:100"/>and that he is the child of God, And there is the faith of <hi>Acknowledgment;</hi> whereby a man does own, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Cauſe, and Truth of Chriſt. I ſhall now ſpend ſome time, and ſhew ye, How Satan ſtrikes at all theſe faiths: and withal labour to ſhew you, How we may bare off his blows, that ſo we may ſtand in the time of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and our faith may not fail.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For the faith of <hi>Reliance:</hi> Satan does ſometimes ſtrike at the faith of Reliance in the Saints, <hi>by hiding from them their former Experiences of Gods gracious dealing with them.</hi> So long as a man hath the ſight, and view of his Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods gracious dealing with him before, he does relye on God, and he ſaies, I will for ever reſt upon God, and relye upon God in Chriſt, for thus and thus he hath dealt w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> me heretofore. Now therfore, Satan does labour in the time of temptation, to hide the Experiences of the Saints from them, and ſo does ſtrike at their faith, and labours to make their faith faile.</p>
               <p>But then, <hi>How ſhould we bare off this blow?</hi>

And if ye look into the 106. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ye ſhall find, that when a man does reſt upon the Promiſe, barely by reaſon of his Experience, his faith will ſoon fail. <hi>The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters covered their enemies</hi> (at the 11. verſe, 'tis ſpoken of the Iſraelites when they came through the red ſea) <hi>there was not one of them left.</hi> Verſe the 12. <hi>Then beleeved they his words.</hi> (Mark) now becauſe of their Experience, now they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Gods word, now they beleeved his promiſe by reaſon of their Experience; <hi>Then beleeved they his words, they ſang his praiſe.</hi> But what became of this?

                  <hi>no not for ſin it ſelf, ſo as to be unthankful for, or unmindful of former mercies.</hi> We are very apt to this; and Satan he comes and tempts, and ſaies unto a poor ſoul, Are you ſpeaking of former mercies, or bleſſings to be thanful for them? That is a good work for others, but as for you, you have committed ſuch a ſin, and it's your duty now to mourn for your ſin committed, look you to that, to be humbled; apply your ſelf to that work: and ſo when he hath gotten a mans heart fix't upon that work in oppoſition to thankfulneſs for former mercies received, the ſoul loſes the ſight of his Experience and ſo his faith failes in the time of temptation. Wherefore my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation is, that you may avoid this blow, and this ſtroke, Never mourn, no not for ſon committed; but ſtill be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for grace received, otherwaies your Experience will go out of ſight, and then your faith failes ye.</p>

               </p>

               <p>Again, Let the heart ſpeak thus: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>If the Lord does give out a Threatning that it may not be fulfilled; and he does give out a Promiſe that it may be fulfilled:</hi> If the very applying of the Threatning, makes the Threatning not to belong to me; and the very applying of the Promiſe, makes the Promiſe to belong to me; then the Threatning does not belong to me, for I have applied it; and the Promiſe does belong to me, for I have applied it; Oh! I remember how my ſoul hath lien trembling before the Threatning, the Lord knows I have often applied the Threatning: but now this is true, That the very applying of the threatning, makes the threatning not to belong to a man; and the very applying of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, makes the Promiſe to belong to a man; and therfore Satan, the Threatning belongs not unto me, but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe does.</p>
               <p>But then again Thirdly, let him ſay thus: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>If I be more godly now, than I was when Satan told me, that the Threatning did not belong to me; and the Promiſe did belong to me, then there is no reaſon for this temptation.</hi> When I went on in a way of ſin, then Satan told me, the Threatning did not belong to me; and then he told me, the Promiſe did belong to me: Oh! but now I am more godly than I was then, I have more of Chriſt than I had then I am ſure, &amp; therfore Satan, Didſt thou tel me, that the Promiſe did belong to me then?

               </p>
               <p>But above all things, remember that of the <hi>Commamnd to beleeve. Luther</hi> was a man that laboured under great temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: and being once ſorely tempted, and the teares trickling down his cheeks; ſaies he my friend (my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual father) came unto me, and ſaid, O my ſon! why doeſt thou mourne? doeſt thou not know that God hath commanded thee to beleeve? When (ſaies <hi>Luther</hi>) I heard that word, <hi>Command,</hi> that God hath Commanded me to beleeve; it prevail'd more with my heart, than all that was ſaid, or thought on before. So ſay I now unto ye, Does Satan come with this temptation, and tell thee, the Promiſe don't belong to thee? Anſwer, I but the Lord hath <hi>Commanded me to beleeve</hi> (Satan) God hath Commanded me to beleeve, 'tis my duty now at this time to beleeve; but I cannot beleeve unleſſe I apply the Promiſe, therefore I may go by commiſſion from God unto the Promiſe, and the Promiſe does belong to me. Thus, give in theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, ſo ſhall ye be able to ſtand, and to relye upon God, and your faith of Reliance ſhall not fail.

               <p>Sometimes Satan does labour to weaken the Aſſurance of the Saints, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> By telling them that they have no faith. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance is the flower of faith, it grows upon faith; but you have no faith (ſaies Satan) and therefore your aſſurance is naught. But how unreaſonable is this temptation! for, obſerve I pray, in what rounds Satan goes: He tempts us to beleeve that we have no faith, becauſe we have no Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and he tempts us again, to beleeve we have no Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, becauſe we have no faith. For anſwer hereunto, I ſhall only turn unto that 4. to the <hi>Romans:</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:162405:102"/>(at the 21. verſe) Being fully perſwaded, that what God had promiſed, he was able alſo to perform. And therefore (at the 22.) it was imputed to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. Now it was not written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him: but for us alſo to whom it ſhall be imputed, if we beleeve on him that raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead. <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by faith, it was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe: and ſaies the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here, it was not written for his ſake, but for us alſo. We are juſtiſied as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, by the ſame faith, what faith is that? is it the faith of Aſſurance? Yes! he was Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured indeed, but I pray of what? He was Aſſured that God was able to performe: He being fully perſwaded, that what he had promiſed, he was able alſo to perform. <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved that God was able, and ſo relyed upon God, and hereby he was juſtified. So it ſhall be with men and women now: if they be Aſſured, and Perſwaded, that God is able, and ſo relye upon God; this is the faith that juſtifies. When therefore this temptation comes, Anſwer unto Satan: Satan, thou ſaieſt I have no Aſſurance, becauſe I have no faith; but I have this Aſſurance that <hi>Abraham</hi> had, whereby he was juſtified, I beleeve God is able to help me, and ſo I relye upon God, and therefore (Satan) I am now juſtified, and ſtand righteous through Jeſus Chriſt in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As he does labour to weaken the faith of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, By telling the Saints that they have no faith: So alſo, by telling them, That they have no Obedience, that they don't profit under the means, that they are not fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: where ever there is true faith, there will be Obedienee, and men will profit under the means, and be fruitful; but you are Unfruitful, and you are barren, and where's your Obedience? here's no Obedience, therefore no faith: So no Aſſurance, your Aſſurance is wrong.</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>But how may we ward,</hi>

               <p>Truly, this blow is not to be warded off, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> if this be true;
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:162405:103"/>That ye never were <hi>Obedient,</hi> never <hi>Fruitful,</hi> never <hi>profited by the means of grace;</hi> this blow fals dead upon the ſoul, this blow is not to be warded off, this is no temptation. But now, if ye have ever been fruitful, if ye have ever been obedient, if ye have ever profited by the means of grace; though for the preſent ye may ſeem dead: yet remember what <hi>Job</hi> ſaies, <hi>There is hope of a tree, though it be cut down, that by the ſcent of waters it will floriſh again.</hi> And ſo, there is hope of thy ſoul, that by the ſcent of the <hi>Goſpel-waters</hi> thou maieſt flouriſh again. But though there be no obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in your own eye, though ye don't profit under the means in your own eye; yet your obedience may be in the eye of others: and in time of temptation, another mans eye is a better judge than your own.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe there ſeem to be no obedience, neither in your own, nor anothers eye; yet the root of the matter may be in you. Ye know how it is with the fiſh, that are in the water, in a windy and a ſtormy day: ye put many fiſh into a pond; and in a faire, ſun ſhiney day, ye ſee them playing upon the water, upon the uppermoſt part of the water; but in a rainy, and ſtormy day, ye ſee none of them there, but yet you ſay, they are all there, they are in the water, they are at the bottome, though you ſee them not. And ſo, it may be, in this ſtormy time of temptation, your obedience, and profiting is not ſeen, but it may be there as heretofore. Satan does never more preſſe a child of God, to try himſelf by ſigns of grace drawn from his own conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, than in the time of temptation. There is indeed a good uſe of ſigns drawn from our own converſation, but this is agreed upon by all, That there's no uſe of them in the time of temptation. And therefore ſaies <hi>Luther: In the time of temptation, I am as if there were no Law, nor no works, but only the righteouſneſs of Chriſt in the world, and ſo I do reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him.</hi> Does Satan come forth therefore with this temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That you have no obedience, that you don't profit, that you are Unfruitful? Anſwer it thus: True Satan, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I am very Unprofitable, and therefore I will learn to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:162405:103"/>profit more; I confeſſe I am very unfruitful, and therefore I will labour to be more fruitful: But (Satan) I will not now at this time determine about my Condition; for it may be a time of temptation: hereafter, at another time, I will come and determine about my Condition, and I will look after ſignes; but now at this time, it may be a time of temptation, and therefore I will forbear to winde, and draw up a concluſion, but leane my ſelf upon God, and reſt upon God at this time.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Sometimes Satan does labour to weaken the <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of Gods people, <hi>the faith of Aſſurance,</hi> to make that to fail, By telling of them, that they have no faith at all, becauſe they have no particular faith, no particular promiſe; for, ſaies Satan thus: faith and Wavering, faith and Doubting do not agree; He that beleeveth doubteth not: but now, you pray and doubt, you beleeve and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ye have no particular word for what you beleeve, therefore ye have no particular faith, ſo no faith at all, and therefore your Aſſurance is naught.</p>

               <p>Again, Tell thine own ſoul, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> That though it pleaſes the Lord to give out a particular word or promiſe ſometimes; yet alwaies he does not. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had a particular word for his recovery; but the three children had not a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

So that, though God is pleaſed ſometimes, to give out a particular word or promiſe, yet alwaies he does not, and therefore my faith may be right (Satan) though I have not a particular word now for this buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Tell thy ſoul this: That though God is pleaſed thus to indulge, and ſometimes to give out a particular promiſe unto his people, and they have a particular faith concerning this or that buſineſſe; yet there is alwaies a Waiting-faith that we reade of in Scripture. There is a faith of Recumbency, whereby a ſoul leans upon God, and commits his cauſe unto God: And there is a Waiting faith. Now therefore (Satan) though I have not a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular word, and a particular faith for this buſineſs; yet notwithſtanding I have a Waiting faith, I can waite upon the Lord my God, and I can reſt upon Jeſus Chriſt: and therefore (Satan) I do yet beleeve, and my faith is right.

And therefore, he comes unto a poor ſoul and ſaies, If you will go on in this way, it ſhall coſt you a priſon; can you lie, and rot, and die in a priſon? he rattles chaines in the ears of a poor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, and ſo labours to ſcare him away from his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and from his faith, and from the Truth and Cauſe of God, and the good waies of Chriſt.</p>

When the Lord cals for any of his people to ſuffer at any time for him, he does give them more ſtrength than before, and he does give them more Comfort and Conſolation than they had before. Now Satan, comes and holds forth the ſuffering, he makes mention of the ſuffering; but he hides the Strength, and the Conſolation. Either Satan holds forth the ſuffering alone; or elſe, if he do mention any ſtrength, or comfort that a gracious ſoul ſhall have in the ſuffering, 'tis but the ſame ſtrength that he hath now, he don't ſpeak of the ſtrength he ſhall have then, and the great Conſolation that he ſhall have then when the ſuffering comes: and ſo theſe being parted, the Suffering and the Conſolation being parted, now our faith fails. When ever therefore this temptation does
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:162405:105"/>come upon you, anſwer thus: <hi>Satan,</hi> here thou bringeſt the ſuffering before me, and cauſeſt that to come before me; but thou doeſt not tell me of the ſtrength I ſhall have, and of the conſolation I ſhal receive <hi>Satan,</hi> I ſhall not have the ſtrength I have now, nor the conſolation I have now, but I ſhall have more ſtrength then, when the ſuffering comes, and I ſhall have more conſolation, when as the affliction comes than I had before.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> Before your temptation comes, while you are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on even ground; Study, and look much into the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and into every corner, and nook thereof, (as I may ſo ſpeak) laying, and treaſuring up Promiſes, and Words ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to every condition. <hi>Let the Word of the Lord dwell in you richly;</hi> that ſo when a temptation comes, ye may have a word ſutable at hand, and this will help ye to bear off the ſtrength of the temptation when it comes.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>3</label> 
                  <hi>Look much unto the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> not the ſinful infirmities, for ſo he had none, but he had many other infirmities. And ye know what the Spouſe in the time of Deſertion ſaies, in the book of the <hi>Canticles, His left hand is under my head, and with his right hand he does imbrace me.</hi> The right hand, is a hand of power; and the left hand, is a hand of weakneſſe: and in the time of Deſertion, and Temptation, it's a great relief to a poor ſoul, to conſider the infirmities of Jeſus Chriſt, his left hand is under our head then. As when a man is inlarged in heart, 'tis good to conſider of Chriſts Example, that ſo he may be humbled under his inlargement: So when a man is in Deſertion, or Temptation, it's good for to think of Chriſts Infirmities, that ſo he may not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, or caſt down too much.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If temptation do come, be ſure of this, <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>That ye don't conclude it is no temptation.</hi> Satan tempts, and then he tempts a man to think it is no temptation. So long as a poor ſoul thinks it is but a temptation, his heart is borne up with comfort, and he ſaies, It is but a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it will be over ſhortly, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will pity me, for 'tis but a temptation, and ſo his heart is borne up with comfort, waiting upon God: But if the Devil can get a man ſo far, as to make him think it is no temptation, but worſe than a temptation; then his heart fails, and his faith failes. Therefore, I beſeech ye, If a temptation come, don't conclude it is no temptation, but ſay, Oh! it may be 'tis a temptation, and therefore I will wait on God.</p>

               <p>Seventhly, <label type="milestone">

When temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation therefore does come upon thee, that thy faith may not fail, now ſtir up thy ſelf to this work of faith, and to beleeve; and if ye beleeve that ye ſhall overcome, ye ſhall overcome; and if ye beleeve that ye ſhall prevaile againſt
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:162405:106"/>your temptations, ye ſhall prevaile againſt your temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And, poor ſoul, if thou canſt relie upon Chriſt, and beleeve that thou ſhalt be juſtified, thou ſhalt be juſtified; and if thou canſt by faith relie upon the Promiſe, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſhall belong to thee. Wherefore, ſtir up your ſelves now to beleeve when temptation comes. When ye have to deal with an Enemy here among men, I don't ſay, beleeve ye ſhall overcome your enemy, and ye ſhall overcome: a man may beleeve he ſhal overcome his outward enemy here in the field, and yet fall before him, and not overcome: but having to deal with this enemy, Gods enemy, your fathers enemy, and your enemy; beleeve ye ſhall overcome him, and ye ſhall overcome him.</p>

               <p>Now that which is expreſt is; <hi>Chriſts tender care of, and love unto his Diſciples in regard of their temptations.</hi> And this love and care of his towards his Diſciples under temptation, is Expreſt in many things.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> Firſt, <hi>In the ordering of their temptations.</hi> For there is no temptation befalls any of His, but he meaſures out the temptation according to their abilities. As a wiſe Phifitian, does not give the ſame Phyſick unto every perſon, but conſiders every ones ability; that which he gives to one, is too ſtrong for another: he conſiders firſt the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his patient, and preſcribes accordingly. Now, though our Saviour Chriſt don't direct Satan for to tempt, yet he does order him in tempting; and Satan cannot put
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:162405:108"/>the leaſt dram into any temptation, but as it is meaſured out by the hand of Chriſt. And this is that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks plainly, in the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. Chapter, and the 13. verſe. <hi>But God is faithful who will not ſuffer you to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above that you are able &amp;c.</hi> that ye may be able to bear it.<note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>139</hi>
                  </note> The Pſalmiſt <hi>David ſaies,</hi> Search me, O Lord, and prove me. That is (ſaies <hi>Gregory</hi>) Firſt, O Lord, look upon, my ſtrength, and then, if I muſt be tempted, ſuffer me to be tempted according to mine ability. Chriſt does meaſure out all the temptations of his people according to their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As he does meaſure out their temptations ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their abilities: <hi>So he does alſo, mortifie their temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and weaken them as they come through his hand.</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them before they do come at his Diſciples, and people, before they do come at you. And upon this account (partly) it is ſaid, <hi>That we are more than conquerers, through Chriſt that giveth victory.</hi> Becauſe our enemy is overcome before he ſtrikes, and his blow is broken as he ſtrikes. And therefore ſaies the Apoſtle, concerning our Saviour, <hi>That he hath ſpoil'd principalities, and powers, and made a ſhew of them openly upon the croſſe.</hi> All your temptations, the power and ſtrength of them were ſpoil'd upon the croſſe. There's no temptation befals any of Gods people, but it is mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and weakned before it does come it them, the ſting, teeth, and the poiſon being taken out.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He does not only thus mortifie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and weaken a temptation before it does come at us: <hi>But he does cauſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſo to lay his temptations, as that he may be diſcerned, and ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome,</hi> Satan tempted <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi> but he tempted in a ſerpent, and ſo <hi>Adam</hi> might eaſily have diſcerned the hand of Satan in it: for <hi>Adam</hi> knew all the creatures; he gave them their Names, &amp; he knew their Natures: and he knew well enough the ſerpent could not ſpeak to him; he might eaſily have known, that the hand of Satan was in the buſineſs. And ſo now, though God does ſuffer Satan to tempt his people, yet he does cauſe Satan ſo to lay his
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:162405:109"/>temptations, as that the black feet of the tempter may be diſcovered: and when a temptation is diſcovered, 'tis half overcome.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> He doth not only thus: But the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hath the <hi>Timeing</hi> of all our temptationps. Time is a great matter in the point of temptation. Should a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation come at ſuch or ſuch a time, poſſibly Gods child might be overwhelmed. I praiſe the Lord (ſaies one) I did reſiſt ſuch a temptation; but had it fallen out at ſuch a time, I ſhould never have been able to have ſtood under it. Satan obſerves his tempting times: he knowes that great advantage may be made unto him by his time. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Chriſt was an hungry, he tempted him to turn ſtones into bread: obſerved his time. And as Satan does obſerve his time to tempt: So our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, does ſet him his time; &amp; the time of his temptations are in the hand of Chriſt. And therefore, if ye look into the 20. chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> the 1. 2. and 3. verſes, ye ſhall find to this purpoſe thus: <hi>I ſaw an Angel come down from Heaven, having the key of the bottomleſs pit, and a great chain in his hand: And he laid hold on the dragon, the old ſerpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him a thouſand years, and caſt him into the bottomleſs pit, and ſhut him up, and ſet a ſeal upon him, that he ſhould deceive the nations no more till the thouſand years ſhould be fulfilled, and after that, he muſt be looſed a little ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> (Mark) The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hath not only the tempter in a chain, that he can go no further than he gives him leave to go; but his hand alſo, is in the hand of Chriſt, and Chriſt hath an eye to the Time of his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a ſpecial eye upon the time of our temptation, and this argues much of his care and love.</p>

                  <hi>in, and by their temptations.</hi> Tempting times, are teaching times unto Gods people: the ſchool of temptation is a great ſchool. <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, that the temptations of Satan, were the imbracings of Chriſt: meaning, that then Chriſt did imbrace his people moſt, and diſcover moſt of his love unto them. Three things (he ſaid) there were that made a Preacher: <hi>Meditation, Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Temptation.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when, or where does God or Chriſt reveal himſelfe more fully unto his people, than in the times of their temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations? 'Tis ſaid, that at <hi>Maſſab</hi> and <hi>Meribah,</hi> the waters of ſtrife and of temptation, there the Lord gave Iſrael his ſtatutes. How many experiences do Gods people get, in, and by their temptations? tempting times are teaching:
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:162405:110"/>and Chriſt teaches his people by their temptations. Satans Buffetings, are the Saints ſchoolings.</p>
               <p>Yea, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, He does not only teach his people; But he does alſo <hi>bear up, and uphold their hearts with new ſupplies of his grace, and Spirit, in the times of their temptations.</hi> Chriſt does not ſuffer his people to go into new temptations, with old ſtrength: but as a new temptation does come from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, ſo new ſupply of grace and ſtrength does come from Chriſt. Saies <hi>David,</hi> in the 94. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and the 18. verſe. <hi>When I ſaid, my foot ſlippeth: thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.</hi> He does not ſay thus: when my foot ſlippeth; thy mercy, O Lord held me up: but when <hi>I ſaid, my foot ſlippeth;</hi> when I thought I was quite <hi>rejected,</hi> caſt off, and forſaken: when I ſaid, my foot ſlippeth: then thy mercy, O Lord, held me up. As new temptations do come in, ſo new ſtrength comes in.</p>
               <p>Yea, and ſupplies of greace in Proportion to our tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee</hi> (ſaies the Lord to <hi>Paul</hi>) my grace is Fit for thee.</p>
               <p>Yea, he does not only give out Proportionable ſtrength; but an <hi>Cverplus of ſirength.</hi> As the woman, that had oyle given her, not enough barely to pay her debt, but an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verplus to live on the reſt. So Gods people in the time of their temptations, have not only ſtrength given them to ſtand out againſt their temptations, but an Cverplus to live on the reſt.</p>
               <p>Yea, and they have not only in-comes of Aſſiſting grace; but of <hi>Accepting grace too;</hi> more Accepting grace. God doth and will then Accept leſſer than at another time. Though the prayer be weak, and the faith low; yet, ſaies the Lord, it is the time of temptation with this my poor ſervant; and therefore I will take the Duty, though it be never ſo little, becauſe it is the time of temptation, it's a time of darkneſs, and a time of ſadneſs. Ye know what our ſaviour ſaid unto <hi>Thomas: Reach hither thine hand, and put it into my ſide:</hi> Come <hi>Thomas,</hi> if thou wilt not beleeve without it, I'le take thy faith, even upon theſe termes, for
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:162405:110"/>I know it is a time of temptation with thee. What grace! what love and mercy is here!</p>
               <p>Yea, Fourthly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt does not only come in thus, with ſupplies of grace, &amp; ſtrength in the times of temptation: But he does give his people an <hi>Eaſe,</hi> and a <hi>Remedy, a breathing time under their temptations, though they be never ſo ſad, and never ſo great.</hi> Indeed, <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, That God was his enemy, and would not ſuffer him to <hi>ſwallow his ſpittle,</hi> he followed him ſo cloſe: but the good man was miſtaken much: for at the ſame time, the time of his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he could ſay, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth;</hi> and he could bleſſe the Lord: he had his breathing time in the midſt of all. When <hi>David</hi> was perſecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> he was under temptation, for, as the Devil caſts ſome men into priſon; ſo the Devil perſecutes in wicked men: yet <hi>David</hi> had his breathing time, now and then, <hi>Saul</hi> given into his hands, as a pledge of that ful deliverance that <hi>David</hi> ſhould have afterwards. And this is no other than that which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, in that ſame 1 of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the 10. Chap. at the 13. verſe, <hi>Who will not ſuffer you to be tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that you are able; but will with the temptation alſo, make a way to eſcape.</hi> Make an <hi>Out-let,</hi> (ſo the word is;) He will make an Out-let. Though the ſmoke be very offenſive, yet there ſhall alwaies be ſome window open for to let it out, or ſome door open for a poor tempted ſoul to go out at: ſtil an out-let, ſome breathing time in the midſt of theſe temptations.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, and laſtly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> As the Lord Jeſus Chriſt liveth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to make interceſſion for us; <hi>So he doth it eſpecially when his people are under temptation; then he prayes for them, and then eſpecially.</hi> I will not determine, whether Chriſt now in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven does intercede Vocally, or Really: but when Satan lies hard upon a poor tempted ſoul, and fetches blood from it, then does the Lord Jeſus ſtep in unto his Father, and preſent his wounds, and his blood, and ſaies unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, O Father, I have prayed unto thee, that this poor man or woman, may not fail in the time of temptation.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:162405:111"/>Thus it was with <hi>Peter</hi> here; I have prayed for thee: and yet this was not the time of his full interceſſion, when he was here on earth. There are two parts of Chriſts Prieſtly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and <hi>Interceſſion.</hi> The proper place for him to make <hi>ſatisfaction for ſin,</hi> was here on earth: and in Heaven, the holy of holieſt, he does make <hi>interceſſion;</hi> there he does do it fully, but he could not for bear while he was here on earth, but he ſaies unto <hi>Peter, I have prayed for thee.</hi> Though my great work in Heaven be to intercede, and my ſpecial work here on earth be to ſatisfie: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I have prayed for thee already <hi>Peter.</hi> And the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was heard in all that he prayed for. Now then, if the Lord Chriſt doth intercede here on earth for his poor tempted ſervants, and was heard here; how much more, when his Diſciples are tempted, does he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, and pray for them in Heaven, and is heard there. Satan may come running in upon you with his temptation: but when Satan runs in upon you with his temptation, Chriſt runs into the preſence of God the Father, and ſpreads his blood, and his ſatisfaction for you, and there he ſaies unto the Father, Father, I have prayed that this man or womans faith may not fail. Oh! what grace and mercy, and love is here! Thus, in all theſe reſpects, (and many others that I might mention) is the love of Chriſt, and his mercy drawn out unto his people in the time of their temptation.</p>
               <p>Well, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>2</label> 
                  <hi>But how may it appear, that Chriſts mercy is moſt at work, when his people are moſt aſſaulted by Satan?</hi> Chriſt deals by His, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> as God the Father did deal by Him. Now ye ſhall find, that Gods love was never more towards Chriſt, than when Chriſt was under temptation. When Chriſt came to die, Satan was very buſie; it's called, <hi>The hour of darkneſs:</hi> ſo buſie was Satan with all his malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; yet then was the Fathers love towards Chriſt, then eſpecially; for ſaies Chriſt, <hi>Therefore does the Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life.</hi> If the Father did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore love him, becauſe he laid down his life, then his love
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:162405:111"/>was moſt at work towards Chriſt when this hour of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was. And ſo I ſay, when you hour of darkneſe is, the hour of temptation; Chriſts love is then moſt at work becauſe he deals by His, as the Father did deal by Him.</p>
               <p>The truth is, Chriſts dealing with his Diſciples, was a pattern and plat-form of his dealing with all his people, to the end of the world. Now ye ſhall obſerve, that Chriſts love was never more let out towards his Diſciples, than from this time, after he had ſaid theſe words, <hi>Satan hath deſired to ſift you as wheat.</hi> After this time they were all offended becauſe of Chriſt, and they all forſook him: <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> denied him; ſome doubted whether he were the Meſſiah or no: and another would not beleeve his Reſurrection; &amp; as ſheep, they were all ſcattered, and ſhattered; great was their temptations: yet from this time, do but obſerve the love of Chriſt towards them: after this ſpeech, then Chriſt preaches a moſt excellent, and ſweet Sermon to them, in the 14, 15, and 16. chapters of <hi>John.</hi> Then he takes wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and a towel, and waſhes and wipes his Diſciples feet. Then he appoints the Lords Supper. Then he ſpends a whol chapter (the 17. of <hi>John</hi>) in prayer for them, makes a moſt excellent, and ſweet prayer for them. Then he cals them his friends: <hi>Ye are no longer my ſervants, but my friends:</hi> Yea, <hi>his Children:</hi> Yea, his <hi>Little children.</hi> Never was his love more drawn out, or expreſt towards them, than after this time. And (I ſay) this was a pattern, and a plat-form of his dealing with all his people unto the end of the world. And therefore, though Chriſt do ſuffer his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be tempted, yet his love and mercy is never more at work than when they are moſt aſſaulted by Satan.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You will ſay, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>3</label> 
                  <hi>What is there in the heart of Jeſus Chriſt, that does incline him to this indulgence toward his people, that his love and mercy is then moſt at work when they are moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by Satan?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My beloved, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> There is the <hi>quinteſcence</hi> of all the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of loving relations in Jeſus Chriſt. A Father, a Mother, a Brother, a Friend; He is the <hi>everlaſting Father. And his
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:162405:112"/>ſoul was in travel</hi> (ſaies the Prophet) <hi>He is not aſhamed to all you his brethren.</hi> And he is a Friend: <hi>I call you my friends.</hi> Now though parents be tender of their children at all times, yet eſpecially when they are ſick; then there's a chair of love ſtands by the childs bed-ſide. And ſo, though Chriſt be alwaies tender of his people, yet then eſpecially, when their ſouls are ſick; and labour under temptation. There is the greateſt pity in Chriſt that can be, the moſt pitiful diſpoſition in Chriſt; which is alwaies laid out where he ſees a fit object for it: pray what is the object of pity? The object of pity is, One whom ye love in miſery. If ye ſee a man in miſery, yet if ye don't love him, ye don't pity him; if ye ſee a man whom ye love, yet if ye don't ſee him in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, ye don't pity him, ye love him, but ye don't pity him: but a perſon whom ye love in miſery, is the object of pity. Now all the Saints and people of God, are the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of Chriſt; and when they are in temptation, that is their greateſt miſery; and therefore, when they are moſt tempted, then is the love and mercy of Chriſt drawn out unto them eſpecially.</p>
               <p>Beſides, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath a great Intereſt, and ſhare in every beleever, a ſhare going in every beleever. As the member hath an intereſt and a ſhare in the head; ſo the head hath alſo in every member. <hi>Thine they were</hi> (ſaies Chriſt) <hi>and thou gaveſt them me.</hi> Chriſt hath a ſpecial and great intereſt in all his people, and he will not loſe his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. The truth is, when Satan does aſſault a beleever, he does rather ſtrike at Chriſt, than at a beleever. And therefore ſaies <hi>Gregory</hi> well, The Devil in tempting <hi>Job,</hi> did not ſo much ſtrike at <hi>Job,</hi> as at God; for the Lord had ſaid, That <hi>Job</hi> was an upright man: and now the Devil would go about to make <hi>Job</hi> an Hypocrite; ſo that the Devill would fain have made God a lyar; and he did not ſo much ſtrike at <hi>Job,</hi> as at Gods teſtimony of <hi>Job,</hi> he did ſtrike at God. And ſo now in all the temptations of the Saints, he ſtrikes at <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and they bear thoſe temptations becauſe of Chriſt. Let a man go on in a wicked, and ungodly way,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:162405:112"/>Satan won't vex him with temptations; but let a man once become godly, and be in Chriſt, and then, how many temptations will Satan vex him with? Now (ſaies Chriſt) ſhall this poor ſoul endure all this for me? and ſhall not I help? ſhall not I aſſiſt? ſhall not I deliver? If a man break his Arme, or his Leg before ye, you will pity him: but if he break his Arme, or his leg in your work, or ſervice, in a work that you ſet him about, you count your ſelf ingaged then to help him. 'Tis the work of Chriſt that the Saints are about, and Chriſt ſets them on work, and when Satan comes to tempt, 'tis to diſturbe them in the work that Chriſt ſets them about: Now therefore, (ſaies Chriſt) ſhall they endure all this becauſe of me, and becauſe of my work? and ſhall not I aſſiſt, and defend them, and help them? Surely I will. Oh! my beloved, if ye did but know what an Intereſt Jeſus Chriſt hath in every beleever, you would eaſily ſee the reaſon of this, ſo great tenderneſs in him, that his love and mercy is never more at work, than when they are moſt aſſaulted by Satan.</p>

               <p>What abundance of Comfort is here unto all thoſe that are the true Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt! you are not alone in your temptations, Chriſt is with you; and he is in Heaven too, interceding, and praying for you: he hath ſent his Spirit into your hearts, to make interceſſion for you there; and he himſelf is in Heaven, making interceſſion and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ying for you there: when you are in temptation, Chriſt is at prayer for you.

Properly a man is ſaid to take up his croſſe, when there is Sin laid on one ſide; and there is a Croſſe, and an Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on laid on the other ſide: Now, either you muſt commit this Sin; or elſe you muſt endure this Croſſe, or Affliction: Nay then, (ſaies a true Diſciple) rather than I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that ſin, I will endure this affliciton; and ſo he takes up his croſs.</p>

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:162405:113"/>miſcarriages: But a true Diſciple of Chriſt, when he hath taken up the croſſe, he follows Chriſt: now properly a man is ſaid to follow Chriſt, when he does do thoſe things at Chriſts command, wherein Chriſt does differ from others.

Now whoſoever thou art that makes this Objection, That thou art not a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore he does not pray for thee in the time of thy temptation; I appeal to ye: Are ye not willing to take up your croſſe? rather to endure that affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, than commit this ſin? Do ye not ſet your ſelf to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny your ſelf, your Pleaſures, Recreations, Relations, and all for Chriſt?

               <p>But beſides this, Our Saviour tels us in the 17. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of <hi>John,</hi> That he did not only pray for thoſe his preſent Diſciples; but (ſaies he) <hi>I pray for all that ſhall beleeve on me through their word,</hi> verſe the 20. What is it to beleeve on Chriſt? To reſt upon Chriſt for life and glory in the time of our temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; this is to beleeve on Chriſt? Now in the time of your temptation, don't ye reſt on Chriſt? don't ye relye on
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:162405:114"/>Chriſt? then Chriſt hath prayed for ye. And though thou art in ſuch a temptation, as thou complaineſt, thou canſt not pray, yet the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath prayed for thee: and he is heard in all that he prayed for.</p>

So that though his fleſh failed, and his heart failed; yet his faith did not fail. There is a great deal of difference between a recoyling fit of a heart-failing in time of temptation, and the failing of ones faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>It is one thing for you to fail in your faith in our own opinion; and another thing for your faith to fail in the opinion of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> When <hi>Peter</hi> denied his Lord and Maſter, in his own opinion he could not but think that his faith failed; and yet in the opinion of Jeſus Chriſt his faith did not fail; for Chriſt prayed that his faith ſhould not fail, and it did not fail, for Chriſt was heard in what he prayed for.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>There is great deal of difference, between the failing of faith, and failings that do accompany faith.</hi> The poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that came to Chriſt, and touched the hem of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, failed very much, for ſhee came behinde him and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:162405:114"/>thought to have ſtolen a cure: I but, though there were many failings that did accompany her faith, yet her faith did not fail; for ſhe came and touched the hem of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and was cured by her faith. So I ſay, there is a great deal of difference between the failing of faith, and the failings that do accompany faith: there may be many fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings that do accompany ones faith, and yet ones faith may ſtand, and not fail.</p>
               <p>But yet further, Whoſoever you are, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that ſay your faith fails you, and therefore you are afraid that Chriſt prayes not for you: Man or woman, Did thy faith ever fail thee like <hi>Peters;</hi> didſt thou ever deny thy Lord and Maſter as <hi>Peter</hi> did? and yet Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I have prayed that thy faith fail not,</hi> and he was heard in the thing that he prayed for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oh! but, that was but one Act in</hi> Peter; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>but my faith doth conſtantly fail;</hi> Peter <hi>denied, and his faith failed in the exerciſe as to one Act, but my faith doth conſtantly fail in time of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I was heretofore more able to beleeve in the time of my temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation than now I am; my faith is failed, and it conſtantly fails, and therefore I fear that the Lord Chriſt will not pray for me in the time of my temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, <hi>But if you be more able to relye upon meer free-grace,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

                  </label> 
                  <hi>than ye have been heretofore, then your faith is not leſs, but increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed rather.</hi> If you be now more able to be contented with your condition, than you were heretofore. If you can let God and Chriſt alone, to uſe his own means about you. If you can leave the Events and ſucceſſes of things, more unto God than you could heretofore; then your faith is not failed, but rather increaſed. Man or woman, if that you are able now to take thoſe hints of a word which you could not heretofore. If your judgment be more ſetled in the Truth. If you be more contented to ſuffer now for the Cauſe, and the way of God than you were heretofore: Then thy faith is not failed, but thy faith is increaſed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo thou comeſt within the compaſſe of the Lord Chriſts prayer.</p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:162405:115"/>
               <p>Oh! <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> but yet (will ſome ſay) <hi>I have ſinned greatly, very much; I have been a great ſinner; and therefore I fear, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will let me alone to wreſtle with my temptations all alone, and will not pray and intercede for me in the time and hour of my temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> I muſt yet ſay again to you: <hi>Haſt thou ſinned more than this</hi> Peter <hi>did, when he denied his Lord and Maſter?</hi> Yet Chriſt prayed for him, and his prayer took and prevailed. Have you ſinned more than Jeruſalem did? <hi>Oh! Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, thou that ſtoneſt the Prophets,</hi> (ſaies Chriſt when they put him to death.) And yet if you look into the 1. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> you ſhall find, that Chriſt after his Reſurrection, bids his Diſciples for to ſtay and wait at Jeruſalem, and not ſtir from thence; and preach the Goſpel, and mercy, and free-grace in Jeruſalem. Haſt thou (man or woman, that makeſt this objection) ſinned more than thoſe that did put Chriſt to death? that run him into his body with a ſpear? that nailed him upon the croſſe? haſt thou ſinned more than theſe? Ye know our Lord and Saviour when he was upon the croſſe, he prayed for them; Oh! <hi>Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, they know not what they do.</hi> But, (Lord) theſe are thine oppoſers, theſe are perſecutors, and they perſecute thee to death. Well, be it ſo, (ſaies Chriſt) I know what I do, and I know whom I pray for: Father forgive them, they know not what they do. Oh! what grace, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and love is here! Comfort, yea, Comfort unto all the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt: when ye are in temptation, the Lord Chriſt is at prayer for you. And remember the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; Never is his love and mercy more at work for ye, than when Satan is moſt buſie about ye, to tempt ye moſt. What comfort is here! This was that (in part) that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted the Martyrs in the Primitive times, ye reade of very great comforts that the Martyrs had in the Primitive times, thoſe times next after Chriſt: I have deſired to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what it was eſpecially, that bore up their hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all thoſe perſecutions. And <hi>Turtullian,</hi> pitches upon this as one thing: We conſider (ſaies he) the caſe of <hi>Peter;</hi>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:162405:115"/>Satan deſired to winnow him; Chriſt prayed for him. Here were (ſaies <hi>Turtullian</hi>) two requeſts before God the Father: One was the requeſt of Satan: and another was the requeſt of Chriſt. Now the Son having more credit with God the Father than Satan, his requeſt muſt needs prevail: So (ſaies he) Satan hath deſired for to tempt, and to winnow us, and perſecute us; but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath requeſted for us: There are two requeſts before God the Father; There's Satans requeſt to winnow us; and there's the Sons requeſt praying for us: Now therefore, ſeeing that the Son hath more credit with God the Father than Satan, therefore are we aſſured that we ſhall be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, and our faith ſhall not fail. And ſo may you alſo. This is matter of great comfort unto all the Saints.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, <hi>Indeed it is matter of great comfort:</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>but is there no Duty that this Truth cals for at our hands? Here is much comfort, but what is that Duty that this Truth cals for?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Much every way.</hi> If I be an Ungodly man; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> what a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty incouragement is here for to get into Jeſus Chriſt, that I may be in the number of the true Diſciples. So long as a man is out of Chriſt, not a true Diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt; Satan may come and tempt, and do what he wil with him, and no Chriſt by to help. Satan could not hurt, or touch, or tempt <hi>Job,</hi> but he muſt ask leave: But Satan went to the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> and brought in them upon <hi>Jobs</hi> Eſtate, and he did not ask leave for that, they were in his power: <hi>He ruleth in the children of diſobedience. Daniel</hi> was in the Lyons-den, and they devouered him not, their mouthes were ſtopt, and they could not hurt him: But when the Enemies were thrown into the Lyons, they crack'd, and cruſh'd their bones before they came to the ground. If a godly man, one that is a true Diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt, if he be in a den with theſe Lyons, Devils, their mouths ſhall be ſtopt, they ſhall not ſwallow him. But oh! for wicked men, that are not in Chriſt, theſe Lyons, they cruſh their bones, every day they cruſh their bones: and a wicked man may ſay as <hi>Saul</hi> did, <hi>The Philiſtims are upon me, and God is departed from me:</hi>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:162405:116"/>So a wicked man, that is not in Chriſt, he may cry out and ſay, Oh! temptations are upon me, and Chriſt is departed from me, I have none of Chriſt to help me: as for the Saints, and thoſe that are true Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, they have Chriſt at hand, though they fall, Chriſt is by for to help them up. And Chriſt himſelf meaſures out all their temptations, and Chriſt aſſiſts them, and helps them, but Oh! as for me, I am all alone in my temptations, I poor ſoul, am all alone in my temptations: Ah! who would be a Drunkard ſtill? who would be a Swearer ſtill? who would be an Unclean wanton ſtill? who would be a lyar, and a Theeviſh ſervant ſtill? Let me tell ye, that while ye go on in theſe ſins, you are out of Chriſt: Poor ſoul, a Swearer, a Drunkard, a common Lyar, a Sabbath-breaker, a Wanton, out of Chriſt, and thy temptations fall heavily upon thee; the Lord knowes, thou art all alone in the time of thy temptations: Oh! but, get into Jeſus Chriſt, get into Jeſus Chriſt, to be in the number of Chriſts true Diſciples; and when thou art tempted, the Lord prayes for thee; yea, and the love and mercy of Chriſt is never more at work for thee, than when thou art moſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and aſſaulted by Satan. What a mighty incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is here to al that hear the word of the Lord, to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeſus Chriſt!</p>
               <p>But if I be godly; and al this be true: Why ſhould I queſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion the love of God towards me in the time of my temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Beloved! ye know it in your Experience, ye are never more apt for to queſtion the love of Chriſt, than in tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and yet Chriſts love is never more at work for you, than in temptation. Oh! what an unworthy anſwering of Chriſts love is here!</p>
               <p>Again, If I be Godly: Why ſhould I not be contented, and quiet under all my temptations, though they be never ſo great? Chriſt prayeth for me, Chriſts love is moſt at work now I am moſt aſſaulted, his bowels then yern to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me.</p>
               <p>Yea, If I be Godly: Why ſhould I not with <hi>Paul</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:162405:116"/>over all temptations? and make my boaſt of Chriſt, and ſay as he did, <hi>Now know I, that nothing ſhall ſeparate me from the love of God in Chriſt;</hi> not Principalities, nor Powers nor Devils, nor Temptations; for when I am moſt tempted Chriſt is moſt at work in love for me.</p>
               <p>Yea, (beloved in the Lord) why ſhould we not all warm our hearts with this love of Jeſus Chriſt? it's a mercy that the Lord Chriſt will caſt but an eye, or a look upon a poor ſoul under temptation; that is a mercy: I but, I tell ye more than ſo; Chriſt does not only caſt an eye, and a look upon a poor tempted ſoul, but his love and mercy is never more at work, than when you are moſt aſſaulted, and tempted by Satan: Ah, what grace, and heart-warming love is here!</p>
               <p>If I be Godly: (again) upon this account, why ſhould I give over ſo ſoon, and lay down my weapon in time of temptation? If a City be beleaguer'd, beſieged, and know that help will come, they will not give over. And though I am thus beſieged, and thus tempted, help will certainly come, for Chriſt hath prayed; why ſhould I give over then in time of temptation?</p>
               <p>And if theſe things be ſo, if there be ſo much love in the heart of Chriſt towards poor tempted ſouls: then (belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) ſhould we not all run to Chriſt in the time, and hour of our temptation, run unto him by prayer?</p>
               <p>It may be there are ſome that will ſay, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>If Chriſt pray for us in time of temptation, what need we pray?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I pray look into this chapter, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> and you will find our Saviour carries it otherwiſe. In the text, ſaies he, <hi>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fall not.</hi> At the 46. verſe, <hi>Why ſleep ye?</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>riſe and pray, leſt ye enter into temptation.</hi> So that, though he had ſaid, That he prayed for them, yet he cals upon them alſo to pray. It's good praying (my beloved) when mercy is coming: and mercy is then coming when Chriſt is praying; and when you are moſt tempted, then Chriſt is at prayer.</p>
               <p>But to end all. What ever your temptations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:162405:117"/>be, you that are the ſervants of God, ſtill think ye hear Chriſt ſaying to ye, Man, Woman, be of good comfort, I have prayed for you: though thy temptations be very great, I have prayed for thee: thought thou canſt not pray for thy ſelf as thou wouldſt, I have prayed for thee: when fleſh fails, and eyes fail, and heart fails, and all fails, yet remember this, Chriſt prayeth for you, in the time of your temptation Chriſt prayeth for you: think that ye hear Chriſt ſpeaking to ye in the time of your temptation, for certainly he does it as well to his Diſciples now as he did to his Diſciples then, he does ſpeak and ſay, Be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, man or woman, though thy temptations be great, yet I have prayed for thee, and thy faith ſhall not fail.</p>

                     <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3</note> Now, ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>Let the brother of low-degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in that he is exalted: and let the brother of high degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in that he is made low: Rejoyce in Tribulation.</hi> A man is to rejoyce more for the opportunity of exerciſing grace, than in all proſperity: there are ſome graces that cannot be exerciſed but in Tribulation, cannot be exerciſed in Heaven; Patience, and the like. Now then, when Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation comes, a Chriſtian ſhould thus look upon it. I have hereby an opportunity of exerciſing that grace, that I had not before, and then he will bleſſe God, and then he will be thankful in that condition: when God takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way one mercy, he gives another: if he take away <hi>Moſes,</hi> he will give a <hi>Joſhua:</hi> if he take away <hi>Ely,</hi> he will give a <hi>Samuel:</hi> if he will take away <hi>Chriſts perſonal preſence,</hi> he wil ſend the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi> And the truth is, he does not ſo much take away, as borrow a mercy; and he payes it again with uſery, and advantage: <hi>Oneſimus</hi> goes away like a thief from <hi>Philemon,</hi> but he returns again with profit to him and others. As for theſe outward things, they will prove but debts at the great day of Judgment: riches now, and gifts now but debts then: and the leſſe ye have of theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, the leſſe ye have to reckon for them. In a bad day, men they ſay, Oh! that I had leſs, my reckoning would be leſſe: the leſſe ye have, the leſſe your reckoning will be.

If a man have a great Farm, and a ſmall ſtock, it is the only way to break him: it's better to have a Farm fit for ones ſtock, than a great Farm. The Lord he ſees what our ſtock of grace is, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he provides a Farm for every one of his Children; and ſometimes it is leſſened, but the reaſon is, becauſe the ſtock of grace is no bigger, they have no more grace to ſtock it withal. Our Gifts, and our Parts, and our Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they are ſo ſtrong ſometimes, that God is fain to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle water therewithal, that we may not be drunk. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to you: are not the Saints gainers by all their loſſes? are not they ſtrengthened by all their weakneſſe? are not they bettered by all their croſſes? Surely then, in all things they are to be thankful: though their affliction be exceeding long, ſharp, and grievous; yet they are to be thankful in that condition.</p>

Is it not a great mercy for a man to be glorified on this ſide heaven? pray look upon that expreſſion which ye have in the 13. of <hi>John,</hi> the 30. and the 31. verſes, 'Tis ſaid concerning Chriſt himſelf, that when <hi>Judas</hi> went out, having received the ſop Jeſus ſaith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. Verſe the 30. Judas, <hi>having received the ſop, went immediately out, and it was night: therefore when he was gone out, Jeſus ſaith, Now is the ſon of man glorified. Judas</hi> went out to betray him, to bring him to the Croſſe, a falſe brother was gone out: Now is the ſon of man glorified (ſaies he) Not only, becauſe the croſs was the way to glory; but the truth is, he was glorified upon the Croſſe, there was a glory there. You may obſerve it, He did many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: and when he had done thoſe miracles, he did not ſay then, Now is the ſon of man glorified. He was Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and he did not ſay upon his Transfiguration, Now is the ſon of man glorified: But now he comes to ſuffer, now he comes to the Croſſe; now (ſaies he) is the ſon of man glorified. And indeed, now is his love to poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners glorified.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15</note> The Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>He triumphed over all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers upon the Croſſe;</hi> and his love triumphs over all our fins, and our guilt, and our unworthineſſe: Oh! then was free-grace, and love when Chriſt was upon the Croſſe: Now is the ſon of man glorified. And ſo it ſhall be with you: When a falſe brother goes out to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you, to betray you, to bring you to the Croſſe: you may ſay ſo, Now is the ſervant of the Lord glorified, now is my love to Chriſt glorified; never more glorified than now. This makes the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeak in the 1. <hi>Peter,</hi> 4.16. <hi>If any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian, let him not be aſhamed, but let him glorifie God on this behalf.</hi> 'Tis matter of Praiſe, and Thankſgiving here: ſaies he (at the 13. verſe) <hi>Rejoyce in as much as ye are partakers of Chriſts ſufferings.</hi> Verſe the 14. <hi>If ye be reproach't for the name of Chriſt, happy are ye; for the Spirit of glory, and of God reſteth on you.</hi> That is (ſaies one
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:162405:120"/>upon that place) As <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove hovered over the water, and found no place for to reſt her foot upon, untill ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Ark: So does the Spirit of God, as it were, hover over the ſouls of men, it wanteth reſt: and when it ſees a ſoul that ſuffers for the Truth, there it lights, there it reſts, there the Spirit of God, and of glory reſts. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to you: which will be moſt comfortable, think ye, at the day of Judgment; <hi>that ye have been perſecuted for the Truth:</hi> or <hi>that ye have been a perſecutor of the Truth?</hi> I know your Anſwer: When a Chriſtian is under perſecution, he may lift up his voice, and ſay; I might have been ingag'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Truth: Ah! I might have been a perſecutor of the Truth: but bleſſed be God it is not ſo. The Apoſtles went away rejoycing, that they were accounted worthy to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt. Surely therefore, there is matter of praiſe and thankſgiving, even in this condition alſo, in this condition a Chriſtian ſhould be thankful: 'tis the will of God our Father we ſhould be thankfull here.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yes,</hi> For though God do withdraw, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> though he do hide his face, and not ſhine upon a Chriſtian: yet it may be light with him. Day may be day though the Sun do not ſhine forth in bright-beams. And it may be day light, it may be day upon a Chriſtian ſoul, though there be never a beam ſhines. We are ſaved by faith, and not by feeling.</p>
               <p>Again, Though Chriſt doth hide his face, though he doth withdraw his Comforting preſence, he never withdraws his Supporting preſence from a Chriſtian; ſometimes more of that, when leaſt of the other. Chriſt deals by a Chriſtian; as God dealt by Chriſt in his agony, and on the Croſſe: though God withdrew his Comforting preſence, ſo as he cry'd out and ſaid, <hi>My God, my God why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.46.</note> Yet he had never more of Gods Supporting preſence: And
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:162405:121"/>ſo 'tis with a Chriſtian. Though Chriſt may withdraw his Comforting preſence, yet he never withdraws his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting preſence from them.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Jeſus Chriſt does ſo withdraw from a Chriſtian as he does draw withall by his Spirit. He ſeemed to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the Canaanitiſh woman, but he did draw her to him by his Spirit. When he withdraws in the 5. of the <hi>Canticles</hi> from his Spouſe, he leaues Myrrhe upon the rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of the door. And ſo, when he withdraws from a Chriſtian, he leaues his Myrrhe upon the ringles of the heart: the heart cannot be quiet, cannot reſt, takes no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment without him, he does draw the ſoul to him, while he ſeems to witndraw from the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, What a man would not loſe for all the world, that, you will ſay, is worthy of Praiſe, and Thankfulneſs. Now take a gracious ſoul, a godly man when he is moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, forſaken, left, as it were; and he ſaies, now Mercy is gone, now Chriſt is gone: Ask him but this Queſtion: If Chriſt be gone, as you ſay, why don't you renounce Chriſt, and renounce all his waies? He will tell you, Oh! no, I dare not renounce him for all the world. But if he be quite gone, Why don't you turn Drunkard? why don't you turn Swearer? and why don't you caſt off all duties? Oh! no, that I dare not: I have yet ſomething left, that I would not loſe for all the world. Is there not then matter of Praiſe, and Thanksgiving in this condition? Surely there is, even in this condition alſo.</p>

               <p>Again, Is it not matter of Praiſe, and Thankſgiving, That nothing hath befallen you, but what hath befallen the beſt of Gods Children, the greateſt Saints? Men ſay ſomtimes, Oh! never any ones condition like to mine: never any affliction like to mine. The moſt godly men have been moſt ſorely tempted.

                  <hi>The Devil ſtood up, and moved him to number the people.</hi> What a report did God give of <hi>Job:</hi> and you know his winnowing, and his continuance.

               <p>Further, Is it not matter of Praiſe, and Thankſgiving, That you have alwaies one for to run unto, to ſuccour you, to relieve you in your temptations? a braſen ſerpent up againſt you be ſtung? <hi>Paul,</hi> therefore, in that 7. of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi> Having ſaid, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from this body of death?</hi> in the next words ſaies: <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> When Satan is tempting, Chriſt is praying, interceding:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Satan hath deſired to winnow thee,</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>but I have prayed.</hi> You cannot pray: True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

               <p>Again, Is it not matter of Praiſe, and Thankſgiving, <hi>That ye have ſuch an Eſtate that theſe theeves can never rob you of?</hi> A Chriſtian is a Traveller: the Thief meets him, and takes his money that he hath about him: But he hath an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of Land at home, the Theif cannot take away from him. And Satan by his Temptations poſſibly may rob you of theſe Comforts that are about you: But you have an Inheritance, and Eſtate (Chriſtian) in heaven, that ſhall never be taken away, that you ſhall never be robbed of.</p>
               <p>I'le conclude this, Is it not matter of Praiſe, and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, <hi>That by this mud you ſhal be more cleanſed?</hi> Beloved! this is Chriſts way: he ſuffers men to be tempted, that they may be freed from more temptations, and he ſuffers this dirt to be caſt upon them, that they may be the more cleanſed. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Simon</hi> (ſaies our Saviour) <hi>Satan hath deſired to winnow thee as wheat:</hi> How ſo? <hi>Satan goes up and down like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> True, that is his intent in his Temptations; Satans intent in the temptation, is not to winnow, that is Chriſts intent: Satans intent in the temptation is to devour, but Jeſus Chriſts intent in al thoſe temptations are to winnow. And who more konwing? who more gracious? who more humble? who more thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than thoſe that have been moſt aſſaulted with a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? Pray obſerve what is ſaid in the 2 of the <hi>Corinths,</hi> 12. Chapter 7. verſe. Saies <hi>Paul. Leſt I ſhould be exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove meaſure through the abundance of revelations, there was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me a thorne in the fleſh, the meſſenger Satan,</hi> (ſo it may be read without, <hi>of.) The meſſenger Satan to buffet me, leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure,</hi> again. See how that goes before and follows: it begins the verſe, and ends the verſe: <hi>Leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure,</hi> at the beginning of the verſe: <hi>Leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure,</hi> at the latter end of the verſe. As if now, that theſe temptations were ſpecial preſervations againſt ſpiritual pride: 'tis ſet down twice, Leaſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure; again, and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:162405:122"/>again. Spiritual pride indeed is very dangerous. It was M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Fox</hi> his ſpeech: <hi>As I get good by my ſins, ſo I get hurt by my graces:</hi> in regard of that ſpiritual pride he was guilty of upon the receipt of them. By Temptation God uſes to keep men humble. The Hebrew word for <hi>Lees,</hi> the Lees of wine; comes from the root, that ſignifies to <hi>Keep,</hi> becauſe the wines are kept by the Lees. And ſo God is pleaſed to keep men humble by theſe Temptations, in theſe Lees, and in theſe dregs God keeps mens graces. Temptations do you no hurt til ye yeeld to them. The greater the Temptation, and the more your fleſh does tremble at it; the greater the Affliction, but the leſſer the Sin. Temptation is the ſouls Rape: it may deflowre your ſoul, offer violence to your ſoul; it cannot take away your innocency. Now, it it not a great mercy to be kept innocent, and chaſt unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt? <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath a notable ſpeech. <hi>If ye praiſe God under good things, ye are paid your debt: if ye praiſe God under evil, ye have made God your debter.</hi> The truth is, we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pay our debt to God, neither are we able to make God our debtor; but God is pleaſed to call himſelf ſo: when men praiſe him under Temptations, and under Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and under Deſertions; God is pleaſed to call himſelf <hi>our Debtor.</hi> Surely therefore, it is good for a Chriſtian to bleſſe God, and to praiſe God in every thing, in all things to be thankful: in Affliction, in Perſecution, in Deſertion, under Temptation: <hi>This is the will of God our Father, that we ſhould be thankful to him in every thing, in every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

               <p>Peſides, Is it not worth our Thankfulneſs, that we have had ſo many daies of Thankſgiving together? A day of Faſting and Prayer, is a ſweet day: a Thankſgiving-day ſweeter, if I may make compate: For in a day of Faſting and Prayer, we deal with the anger, and wrath, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God: In a day of Thankſgiving with the love of God, and the mercy of God. In a day of Faſting and Prayer, we exerciſe Grief: But in a day of Thankſgiving, we exerciſe Joy, and love. In a day of Faſting and Prayer, your eye is upon your ſins: In a day of Thankſgiving, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your graces, to be Thankful for them. As the fiſh

In a day of Faſting and Prayer, ſometimes, ye are ſo humbled for ſin committed, as the ſence of your Juſtification is quite ſhattered: But in the day of Thankſgiving, your aſſurance for heaven is ſealed: they are ſweet daies. And beloved! you have had many of them of late; and ſurely this is worth our Praiſe.</p>
               <p>But give me leave a little to Enumerate; for Enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is one kind of Argument: Hath not the Lord from heaven, owned his own Cauſe in the hands of his ſervants, our brethren in the field? Hath not the Lord heard your Prayers? Hath not the Lord opened many Mines of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Truths that ye never knew before? Hath not the Lord delivered you from the hand of a ſavadge Enemy? Thoſe that lay among the pots, brought forth with doves-wings: Victory after Victory; one treading upon the heel of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, overtaking another? Does he not daily load you with his benefits? I cannot ſay, as <hi>David</hi> in the 9. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and the 1. verſe: <hi>I will praiſe thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: I will ſhew forth all thy marveilous works.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part, <hi>I will praiſe thee, O Lord, with my whole heart,</hi> you will ſay: But the latter part, <hi>I will ſhew forth all thy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veilous works;</hi> Who can ſay? they are beyond us.</p>
               <p>And now Beloved, if it be our duty to Praiſe God, to be Thankful to him in every condition, when we are low: ſhall we not be thankful to him now, that the Lord hath raiſed us, and fill'd us thus?</p>

                  <hi>There's one thing that hinders us in the work of Praiſe and Thanksgiving in theſe times: A Reformation is now begun, and things do not ſucceed according to our deſires in the matter of Reformation: ſhould we? can we be Thankful now?</hi>

When the Iſraelites had overcome their enemies, in <hi>Samuels</hi> time; though the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were round about them, they ſet up a ſtone, and called it <hi>Eben-ezer,</hi>

                  <hi>Hitherto the Lord hath helped us.</hi> Beloved! in our Thankſgiving we are to be like unto Jeſus Chriſt: He did not only praiſe God when he had the mercy, but before he had it, in the entrance upon it. When he raiſes up <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> from the dead:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>To honour the Lord with our ſubſtance; and with the firſt fruits of all our increaſe.</hi> Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye have the firſt-fruits of <hi>Reformation;</hi> or not.

God does give a leſſer mercy to try us, whether we will be Thankful, that he may give a greater. Beloved! theſe are trying times, God tries us whether we will be Thankful for what we have. A Reformation is now on foot: what though things don't ſucceed according to your deſire, ſhall we not be Thankful for what we have, becauſe we want ſomething of what we would have? when then ſhall we be Thankful?</p>

                  <hi>He was numbered among tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors:</hi> Should not I love Chriſt, or own Chriſt, or be Thankful for Chriſt; becauſe he was numbered among tranſgreſſors? The Errours of the time, you ſay, are the tranſgreſſors of the time: Shall I not love the Truth, and own the Truth, and be thankful for the Truth, becauſe it is numbered among the tranſgreſſors, the tranſgreſſors of the time? Bleſſed is that man that can ſee a beauty in Truth, when it hath a ſcratch't face. And indeed every Truth hath a beauty; &amp; the Lord hath given you out many Truths in theſe times, that ye were ignorant of before. Beloved! I do not ſay, that ye ſhould be thankful for any Errour: we ought to be grieved for any Errour. But ſhall we be ſo mindful againſt Errour, crying out againſt Errour, Errour; as not to be thankful for any Truth we have? If the whole world were ſpread with Errour; that one Truth living: <hi>Jeſus Chriſt died for ſinners;</hi> there were matter of Praiſe. The more Errour does prevail, the more mercy it is, that you are kept. And truely, the only way, or a ſpecial way to be kept from Errour, is to be thankful for Truth. As a way to be kept from ſin is to be thankful for grace: So a ſpecial way to be kept from Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, is to be thankful for Truth. So then, Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all this; yet you are to be thankful: Thankful even in this condition, though many Errours yet ye are to be thankful, to be in all things thankful, in every thing thankful. Thankful when ye are ſtraitened, as well as when ye are moſt enlarged. Thankful when ye are Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as well as when God ſhines upon you. Thankful when ye are Afflicted, as well as when ye are Delivered. Thankful when ye have no Victories, as well as when ye have Victories. Some, it may be, now will Praiſe the Lord
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:162405:125"/>and be Thankful; hearing of ſo many Victories; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there may be ſome hopes of Peace: But beloved, 'tis our duty to be in every thing Thankful: 'Tis the will of God our Father, that we ſhould be Thankful in every thing, Thankful in every condition.</p>
               <p>Give me leave to propound ſome few Incouragments hereunto: for it ſeems a hard thing to be Thankful in every thing, in every condition.</p>
               <p>If you can be thankful in every thing; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> even when ye are low: you will engage God for to raiſe you up: If when you are weak; you engage God for to make you ſtrong: If when you are Deſerted; you engage God to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large you, to ſhine upon you. It pleaſes God much, you cannot pleaſe him more, than to be Thankful in every thing, even when ye are low. For Example. Suppoſe a man be convinc'd of ſin, troubled in Conſcience, hath no aſſurance of Gods love in Chriſt: If he ſhould die, he does not know whether he ſhould go to heaven, or hell. Yet notwithſtanding (ſaies he) what ever become of me, I bleſs the Lord that I am come hither: I was going on in the moſt ſad condition: the Lord hath opened my eyes, I ſee indeed nothing but the wrath of God, due for my ſins: but yet bleſſed be the Lord, that hath opened my eyes to ſee this: I, (ſaies the Lord) doeſt thou bleſſe me becauſe I have opened thy eyes for to ſee thy ſins? I'le open thine eyes for to ſee thy Saviour. Doeſt thou bleſſe me, becauſe I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened thy eyes to ſee thy own heart, and the naughtineſs thereof? I'le open thy eyes to ſee all my grace, and I'le cauſe all my grace to paſſe before thee. This engages God, when ye can be thankful for every thing, and when ye are low: it engages God much unto you.</p>
               <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Hereby your Afflictions ſhall be made bleſſings unto you. You ſay, How ſhal I know whether an Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be a bleſſing or no? Take this note: when thou canſt bleſſe God under an Affliction, then thy Affliction is made a bleſſing: thy very bleſſing of God under an Affliction, makes thy Affliction a bleſſing to thee. <hi>Job,</hi> greatly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:162405:125"/>and he bleſt God, and his Affliction was a bleſſing to him: ſo ſhall it be with you. Touch but thy Affliction with a Thankful heart, it will turn it into gold.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The more you can be Thankful for any thing, when ye are low; the more peace ſhall your heart, and your ſoul be fild with. Some of you, (it may be) want peace of Conſcience; and ye ſay: Oh! that I had peace within, whatever become of me Outwardly: whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the world do with me, Oh! that I had peace within.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe conſider the 4. to the <hi>Philippians:</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle: <hi>Be ye in nothing careful</hi> (at the 6. verſe) <hi>but in every thing, by prayer, and ſupplication, with thanksgiving; let your requeſts be made known unto God. And the peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding ſhall keep your hearts and minds through Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> This is the way to get a great, and a full peace: Be in nothing careful: be in all things Thankful, then the peace of God ſhall guard you.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Hereby ye ſhall ſhame the Devil: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> your great adverſary ſhall retreate from tempting of you, as one aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and confounded. Some there are that ſhame the Saints: and are a ſhame to the waies of God, the Goſpel: Some there are that ſhame the Devil: The Devil ſaid unto God concerning <hi>Job, Do but touch him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job,</hi> 1.11 12 &amp; 21</note> 
                  <hi>and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> ſaies the Lord, <hi>He is in thy hand, only ſave his life:</hi> and Satan touch't him: what then? <hi>The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away; bleſſed be his Name.</hi> The Devil ſaid, he would Curſe God, and he bleſſes God: See how the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is ſham'd, and confounded here. Some there are that make the Devils words good: <hi>Touch him, and he will curſe thee to thy face:</hi> and ſo do ſome do, and thereby they are a ſhame indeed unto the people of God, and the waies of God. But when people can bleſſe God under Affliction: if ye in every this be Thankful; the Devil is confounded, God is much honoured. Wherefore (beloved) as ye deſire that God may be much honoured by you: the Devil confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: your own peace ſetled: all your afflictions turned into bleſſings: and the Lord engag'd to you, to raiſe you
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:162405:126"/>up when ye are low: learn out this leſſon, not only to be Thankful when ye are full, but to be Thankful when ye are empty, to be in every thing Thankful, this is the will of God your Father.</p>
               <p>How ſhall we do this? <label type="milestone">

                  </label> (you will ſay:) how muſt that be done?</p>
               <p>Some few things in anſwer to that, and ſo I will wind up all.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> Obſerve your own temper, and accommodate your ſelves: put thy ſelf upon that duty, and that grace, which thine own diſpoſition lies next unto. God hath given us this indulgence.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Is any afflicted? let him pray: is any merry? let him ſing Pſalms.</hi> According to your diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition (ſaies he) that is the meaning: So let your work be, ſo let your grace be.

It may be thou canſt not Sing: by that time thou haſt been at Prayer, which thy diſpoſition lies next unto, thou wilt be fit to Sing, Let us not be more cruel to our ſouls than God is: he hath give us this indulgence: obſerve your ſelves, accommodate your ſelves; and by this means you ſhall be able upon all occaſions to bleſſe and praiſe the Lord.</p>
               <p>Again. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Be ſure of this, that you maintain your Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance freſh, and green. It's a hard thing for a man to be thankful in every thing, that wants Aſſurance, Come to him for to praiſe God for a great work: but it may be (ſaies he) it came in Judgment to me, I have no Aſſurance. Strengthen your Aſſurance in theſe Three things, and it will cauſe continual Thankfulneſſe, Thankfulneſſe in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing: Aſſurance of your Intereſt in Chriſt, and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him: Aſſurance that all comes from love: Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that all things work together for your good: and then if the Tempter come, and ſaies, Wilt thou praiſe the Lord? doſt thou not ſee how all thy acquaintance hath left thee? and all thy friends left thee? you will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:162405:126"/>again, I but, all this is for my good, and all this comes out of love, and ſo what ever fals out, you will be thankful in every thing.</p>
               <p>Deſire not Much: he that deſires much, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> will expect much; and he that expects much, he won't be content with little, much leſſe Thankful for every thing. <hi>Jacob</hi> was a plain-hearted man: he deſired little, he was content with leſs, he was Thankful for every thing. So muſt you be.</p>
               <p>And if you do deſire much, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> let your eye be as much upon what ye have: as upon what ye want. The Covetous rich man, having a deſire to have more is not Thankful for what he hath: if you come to borrow money of him: (ſaies he) I have need to borrow of you, I am a very beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, I have nothing. His eye is ſo much upon what he would have, he forgets what he hath. So many times it fals out ſpiritually: let your eye therefore be as well upon what you have, as upon what you want.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Be ſure of this, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that you maintain the ſenſe of your own unworthineſs. No man more Thankful than <hi>David;</hi> no man more ſenſible of his unworthineſs than <hi>David:</hi> Continually thankful; Continually ſenſible of his unworthines. There is a Two-fold unworthines: <hi>Creature</hi>-unworthineſs: and <hi>Sinful</hi>-unworthineſs. Accordingly a Two-fold ſence of unworthineſs: One that ariſes from the apprehenſion of creature-unworthines, of the emptines that is in us as Creatures: And another that ariſes from ſenſe of guilt of ſin. See them both in the 8. <hi>Pſalm:</hi> The Pſalmiſt there praiſes the Lord: <hi>O Lord our God,</hi> (verſe the 1.) <hi>how excellent is thy Name in all the Earth! when I conſider the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the work of thy fingers, what is man that thou art mindful of him? and the Son of man that thou viſiteſt him.</hi> He praiſes the Lord, this Thankfulneſs was raiſed from the ſenſe of unworthineſs, it was Creature-unworthineſs: <hi>Lord, what is man? O Lord our God, how excellent is thy Name in all the earth! Lord, what is man?</hi> Look into the 116. <hi>Pſalm:</hi> and there ye find the Pſalmiſt praiſing God upon the ſence of unworthineſs too: <hi>Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; yea,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:162405:127"/>our God is merciful.</hi> (verſe the 12.) <hi>What ſhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits towards me?</hi> here's his Thankfulneſs; it was raiſed upon ſence of unworthineſs: But what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs? Sinful unworthineſs: (verſe the 11.) <hi>I ſaid in my haſt; all men are lyars: what ſhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits towards me?</hi> He was ſenſible of his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, and it was a ſinful unworthineſs: <hi>I ſaid in my haſt; all men are lyars:</hi> yet God is gracious to me, <hi>What ſhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits?</hi> So now it will be with you: if ye can but keep the ſenſe of your own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, you wil ſay; I was a wretched, and a great ſinner, and though I have but little in the world, yet any thing is too much for one that was ſuch a great ſinner as I was: you will be Thankful for every thing, in every thing Thankful, maintain but this. Beloved! ye ſee how in all theſe troubles of theſe times, God hath given us our lives for a prey. As the Lord ſaid concerning <hi>Job. Only ſpare his life:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job,</hi> 2.6.</note> So hath the Lord ſaid concerning us, ſpare their lives. God did not deal ſo by our Saviour Chriſt: when our Saviour Chriſt came into the world, he met with hard dealing from wicked men, and his life went for it; he did not ſay, <hi>Only ſpare his life;</hi> his life went for it. You have more in this reſpect than our dear Saviour had: you have your lives given you for a prey in theſe evil times, our Saviour had not. Shall we not then be Thankfull in every thing? having more than our Saviour had in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: ſhall we not be Thankful for any thing? for any thing that God gives us, ſhall we not now be Thankful? How many are there, that walke directly contrary unto this Truth that I have ſpread before you? <hi>In every thing Thankful,</hi> and they in nothing Thankful, in nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented: Husband godly; Children hopeful; Eſtate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable; and yet never contented: Servants cannot pleaſe, Children cannot pleaſe, friends cannot pleaſe; never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented: Oh! is this a duty, to be in every thing Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? how do they lie in a ſin, and the breach of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that are in nothing contented, never pleaſed?
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:162405:127"/>Beloved! I don't now come to call for contentment, and patience, and quietneſs under Affliction; but for Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs: and not for thankfulneſs only when all goes well with you; but for Thankfulneſs in every thing. Oh! therefore, let us return unto our own ſouls, conſider how it hath been with us. If there be ever a diſcontented man or woman reade this Sermon: conſider this Scripture: The Lord ſaies, <hi>be in every thing Thankful,</hi> and thou haſt been in nothing Thankful, in nothing contented in thy condition. Oh! how will you anſwer it at the great day? Let me leave this Exhortation with you, in your boſoms: the Lord knows into what condition we may come; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into Affliction, or Perſecution, or Deſertion, or of Temptation: Remember, here lies your duty before you; lay it up in your hearts: <hi>'Tis the will of God, even our Father, that we ſhould be Thankful to him in every thing:</hi> not in ſome things, not when things go well only; when we have Victory: but in all things Thankful: <hi>In every thing give Thanks unto God, for this is the will of God our Father concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you.</hi>
