         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul,</hi> (whom I take to be the Pen-man of this Epi≈øtle) having in the former part of this Chapter, ≈øhewed the Rea≈øons, why it behoved Chri≈øt for to ≈øuffer death: He comes now, in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end thereof, to give you an account, by laying down ≈øome Rea≈øons, <hi>Why it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:162405:14"/>behoved Chri≈øt, to be in all things made like unto us,</hi> whom the Apo≈øtle here cals the <hi>Brethren</hi> of Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>In other Scriptures we find, that our Lord and Saviour Chri≈øt, is called our Father, The everla≈øting Father, the Prince of peace. Here he is called <hi>our Brother,</hi> we <hi>his Brethren.</hi> Now the ≈øame Per≈øon, to be both a Father, and a Brother unto the ≈øame man, in nature it cannot be.</p>
               <p>But becau≈øe all the≈øe Relations, are to ≈øcant, and narrow Ve≈ø≈øels to hold forth the love of Je≈øus Chri≈øt towards us: Therefore Incon≈øi≈øtent Relations are given unto him. A Father Provides for his child, which the brother doth not. A Brother can ≈øtoop, and conde≈øend unto his brother, which the ≈øuperiority of the Father will not bear. So that here is held forth unto us, the ≈øtooping, Conde≈øending love of Je≈øus Chri≈øt: and therfore he is called our Brother, and we his Brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But why,</hi>

                  <hi>and what Rea≈øon is there, That the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt ≈øhould in all things be made like unto us his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apo≈øtle in the≈øe words gives the Rea≈øon, <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>That he might be a merciful, and a faithful high Prie≈øt, in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ≈øins of the people, &amp;c.</hi> The Lord God our Father, ≈øwear unto Je≈øus Chri≈øt, Thou art a Prie≈øt for ever, after the order of <hi>Melchizedek.</hi> He was to be the great high Prie≈øt. Among the Jews, in the times of the old Te≈øtament, they had an high Prie≈øt, that was in all things to ≈øtand between God and them, and in ca≈øe any ≈øinned, to make an atonement for them. As the Jewes had their High Prie≈øt: So the <hi>Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> he was to be, and he is, <hi>The Apo≈øtle,</hi> and the <hi>High Prie≈øt</hi> of our Chri≈øtian profe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was of the Jewes profe≈ø≈øion. And therefore ≈øaies the Apo≈øtle, <hi>It behoved him, in all things to be made like unto us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But could</hi> not Je≈øus Chri≈øt be merciful unto poor tempted ≈øouls, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> unle≈øs he were in all things made like to them: like in their <hi>Natures,</hi> like in their <hi>Affections,</hi> like in <hi>matter of Temptations.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:162405:14"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chri≈øt as God,</hi> could have been merciful unto us, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈ø. </seg>
                  </label> although he had not been made like unto us: <hi>but not as our High Prie≈øt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is an ability of Sufficiency, and of Power: and ≈øo Chri≈øt as God, was able to ≈øuccour tho≈øe that are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, although him≈øelf had never been tempted. But there is an ability of Idoneity, or Fitne≈øs, or Aptne≈øs and Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition: and ≈øo the Apo≈øtle ≈øaies here, For in that Him≈øelf hath ≈øuffered being tempted, he is able to ≈øuccour them that are tempted.</p>
               <p>It's plain then, what that is, that is the great ≈øupport of a Chri≈øtian again≈øt all Temptations: wherein lies our ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour again≈øt all Temptation, namely, in the Prie≈øtly-Office of Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Prie≈øtly-Office of Chri≈øt, Is it the great Magazine, and Stonehou≈øe, of all that Grace, and Comfort which we have on this ≈øide Heaven: It is that, whereby we are reconciled to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and relieved again≈øt all temptation. This is the great thing that the≈øe words hold forth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, upon this account, the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul,</hi> finding the Hebrewes labouring under great Temptations, Doubtings, Fears, and much Unbeleef; he does not only here, but all along in this book of the Hebrews, open the Prie≈øtly Office of Chri≈øt unto them.</p>
               <p>And indeed, what comfort can we have in God Him≈øelf, but through Chri≈øt? and what comfort can we have in Chri≈øt Him≈øelf, but as he is cloathed with his Pre≈øtly-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with his Office of the High Prie≈øt? What≈øoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort we have in the other Offices of Chri≈øt, namely his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and his <hi>Prophetical Office,</hi> it is all Originated, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiated <hi>in this:</hi> The Prie≈øtly Office of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, it does give a Life, and Being, and Efficacy to both the other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And therefore, the High Prie≈øt, in the times of the old Te≈øtament, (who was a Type of Chri≈øt) he wore a Crown, upon his head, and the brea≈øt-plate of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>rim,</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> upon his brea≈øt: ≈øhowing, that both the other Offices, the Kingly, and the Prophetical Office, were planted upon the Prie≈øtly Office of Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:162405:15"/>
               <p>Yea, If you look into the, Fir≈øt, Second, and Third Chapters of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> you will find, that what≈øoever ≈øtreames of comfort did run down upon the Churches through the other Titles, and Attributes of God, they are all fountain'd here. In the Second Chapter, and the fir≈øt ver≈øe. The Lord Chri≈øt hath this Title, That he holdeth the ≈øeven ≈øtars in his right hand! <hi>The≈øe things ≈øaith he that holdeth the ≈øeven ≈øtars in his right hand.</hi> In the Eight ver≈øe writing unto the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> he takes up another Title, or Attribute: <hi>The≈øe things ≈øaith the fir≈øt and the la≈øt, which was dead and is alive.</hi> At the Twelf ver≈øe, writing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> he takes up another Title: <hi>The≈øe things ≈øaith he, who hath the ≈øharp ≈øword with two edges.</hi> Now look into the fir≈øt Chapter, and you ≈øhall ≈øee, that tho≈øe ≈øeveral Titles, wherewith he cloaths Him≈øelf when he ≈øpeaks unto the Churches ≈øeverally, are all ≈øummed up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the 16. ver≈øe. <hi>And he had in his right hand ≈øeven ≈øtars;</hi> There's his Title unto the Church of <hi>Ephe≈øus: And out of his mouth went a ≈øharp two-edged ≈øword:</hi> There's his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle unto the Church of <hi>Pergamus.</hi> And at the 18. ver≈øe. <hi>I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive for ever more;</hi> There's another Title, that he u≈øeth when he ≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto the Church of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> But in the 13. ver≈ø. is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the fountain of all the≈øe ≈øtreams: <hi>In the mid≈øt of the ≈øeven candle≈øticks, I ≈øaw me like unto the Son of man, cloathed with a garment down to the foot; and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</hi> This was then the robe and attyre of the High Prie≈øt: Who≈øe garment came down unto his feet, and he was girt about with a golden girdle. So that all the≈øe other Attributes, and Titles of Chri≈øt, they have their ri≈øe here, here is the <hi>≈øpring-head</hi> of all tho≈øe con≈øolations, even <hi>the Prie≈øtly Office of Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>U≈øually, Tho≈øe Excellencies, and Attributes of Chri≈øt are mo≈øt beneficial unto the Saints, that are mo≈øt oppo≈øed by the world. What Title, Attribute; or Excellency of Chri≈øt is there, that is more invaded by the world, than the

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:162405:16"/>fiery ≈øerpents, then they had a bra≈øen-≈øerpent for to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a reliefe again≈øt that di≈øtre≈ø≈øe. When they wanted water, they had the water out of the Rock, as a reliefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt that di≈øtre≈ø≈øe. When they wanted Bread, they had Manna from Heaven, as a reliefe again≈øt that di≈øtre≈øs. But when they ≈øinned, whither did they go? Then they took a ≈øacrifice, and went unto the Prie≈øt, and he was to offer for them. So that the Prie≈øtly Office then, was the only relief they had again≈øt ≈øin.</p>
               <p>And ≈øo now, the Prie≈øtly Office of the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, it is that great ≈øuccour, and relief which Chri≈øtians have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt all Temptations under Heaven.</p>

                  </label> hereunto, I will begin this exerci≈øe with one Particular of the Prie≈øtly Office of Chri≈øt, in ≈øhewing what a relief, and ≈øuccour <hi>it is</hi> unto a Chri≈øtian again≈øt all Temptations, and what a bottome of comfort, and ≈øpecial means of Grace and Holine≈øs.</p>
               <p>The text ≈øaies, That the <hi>work of the</hi> High Prie≈øt is, To make reconciliation for the ≈øins of the people. In the times of the old Te≈øtament, the High Prie≈øt made an Atonement for the people: in ca≈øe any man had finned, he brought a ≈øacrifice, and his ≈øins were laid upon the head of the ≈øacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Once every yeer, the High Prie≈øt did enter into the holy of holie≈øt, and with the blood of the Sacrifice, did ≈øprinkle the Mercy-Seat, and laid the ≈øins of the people upon the head of the ≈øcape-goat and ≈øo made an atonement for the people. All which will cleerly appear, in that, 16. of <hi>Liviticus,</hi> at the 14. ver≈øe. He ≈øhall take of the blood of the bullock, and ≈øprinkle it with his finger upon the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-Seat ea≈øt-ward: and before the Mercy-Seat ≈øhall be ≈øprinkle of the blood with his finger ≈øeven times. And at the 21. ver≈øe. <hi>And Aaron ≈øhall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confe≈ø≈øe over him all the iniquities of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:162405:16"/>of I≈ørael, and all their tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions, in all their ≈øins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and ≈øhall ≈øend him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderne≈øs, and ≈øo he ≈øhall make an atonement,</hi> as in that Chapter. This was the work of the High Prie≈øt, in ca≈øe any had finned, to make an atonement, and ≈øatisfaction (by way of Type) for the ≈øins of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Now for the better proof of <hi>this great Go≈øpel-Truth</hi> that I have propounded, I ≈øhall in≈øi≈øt on the≈øe Five things.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>That when the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt died upon the Cro≈ø≈øe, he did offer up Him≈øelf a ≈øacrifice unto God the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That when this ≈øacrifice was upon the Altar, then the ≈øins of all beleevers, pa≈øt, pre≈øent, and to come, were all laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That when the≈øe ≈øins were thus laid upon Chri≈øt, he did thereby give full ≈øatisfaction unto God the Father, unto Divine Ju≈øtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>That all this he did as our great High-Prie≈øt, and in a more Tran≈øcendent, and Eminent manner, then ever any High Prie≈øt did before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>How all this doth conduce to our Comfort, and to our Holine≈øs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>When our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt died upon the Cro≈øs, He did offer up him≈øelf a ≈øacrifice unto God the Father.</hi> He did not (as the <hi>Socinians</hi> ≈øay) die only as an example for to teach us how to die; but he offered up him≈øelf a ≈øacrifice unto God the Father then. Yea, as if all ≈øacrifices were met in him; all tho≈øe titles that are given unto other Sacrifices, they are given unto him. There were Three ≈øorts of Sacrifices: ≈øome were living; others were not living, and tho≈øe were either ≈øolid, as bread and the like; or el≈øe, they were liquid, as wine and oyle. There was a alwaies, <hi>De≈øtructio rei oblatiae,</hi> A de≈øtroying of the thing offered. If it were a living thing that was ≈øacrificed, then it was ≈øaid to be ≈ølain: In an≈øwer to that, Je≈øus Chri≈øt is ≈øaid to be a Lamb ≈ølain from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world. If it were a dead thing that was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up, as bread, or corn, a ≈øolid thing, then the ≈øacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:162405:17"/>or offering was ≈øaid to be brui≈øed. In an≈øwer to that, our Lord and Saviour Chri≈øt is ≈øaid to be brui≈øed for our iniquities. If it were a liquid thing that was offered up to God, as wine, or oyle, then it was ≈øaid to be powred out. In an≈øwer to this, it is ≈øaid of our Lord and Saviour, That his ≈øoul was powred out unto death. Thus all Sacrifices meeting in him. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God</hi> (≈øaies <hi>John</hi> the Bapti≈øt when he ≈øaw Chri≈øt.) He does not ≈øay, Behold the Bull of God, or the Goat of God; and yet Buls, and Goats were ≈øacrificed. Why does he rather ≈øay, behold the Lamb of God, than the Bullock, or the Goat? For when the High Prie≈øt went into the Holy of Holie≈øt, and ≈øprinkled the Mercy-Seat, he did not ≈øprinkle the Mercy-Seat with the blood of the Lamb, but with the blood of a Goat; and yet notwith≈øtanding, it is not ≈øaid, Behold the Goat of God, but, Behold the Lamb of God: Why ≈øo? Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becau≈øe that Chri≈øt was of a lamb-like, and meek di≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition (as ≈øome would have it:) Nor only becau≈øe, that the great Type of Chri≈øt, was the Pa≈øcal-Lamb, (though the≈øe be rea≈øons.) But there was a dayly ≈øacrifice in the Temple; whether men brought any offering or no, there was a ≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ≈øacrifice in the Temple, morning, and evening, and that ≈øacrifice was a Lamb. Now therefore, to ≈øhew, that Je≈øus Chri≈øt is the dayly ≈øacrifice, therefore he cries out, and ≈øaies, Behold the Lamb of God, and not the Goat of God; for the Goat was not ≈øacrificed every day as the Lamb was.</p>
               <p>For proof of this, take the Apo≈øtles Exhortation, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Walk in love, as Chri≈øt hath loved us, and hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf for us, an offering, and a ≈øacrifice to God.</hi> Here are Three things con≈øiderable. Fir≈øt, He does not ≈øay, <hi>Who hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us:</hi> but, to ≈øhow his great love unto us, <hi>Who hath given him≈øelf for us:</hi> He doth not ≈øay, <hi>Who hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf for our ≈øins:</hi> Yet he ≈øaies ≈øo, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Who gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf for our ≈øins;</hi> But, <hi>Who gave him≈øelf for us.</hi> Why? To ≈øhew, who they were that he gave him≈øelf for: He gave him≈øelf for us, as ≈øinners. Again, He ≈øaies here, He gave
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:162405:17"/>him≈øelf for us, an offering, and a ≈øacrifice, not only an offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but a ≈øacrifice too. So that this fir≈øt Propo≈øition is cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved, That our Lord Je≈øus, <hi>when he died upon the Cro≈ø≈øe, he did offer up him≈øelf as a ≈øacrifice unto God the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As he did offer up him≈øelf a ≈øacrifice unto God the Father: <hi>So when he was upon this Altar, this ≈øacrifice; the ≈øins of all beleevers were then laid upon Je≈øus Chri≈øt:</hi> tho≈øe that do now beleeve, or ≈øhall hereafter beleeve, they were all then laid upon Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Look into the 53. of <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> ver. 6. <hi>All we like ≈øheep have gone a≈øtray, and have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all.</hi> That which God laies on ≈øhall never be taken off, no man ≈øhall take it off: The <hi>Lord</hi> hath laid on him the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquities of us all.</p>
               <p>Yea, Our iniquities are not only ≈øaid to be laid on him, but (to u≈øe the ≈øame word that is u≈øed for the ≈øacrifice) it is ≈øaid, he bare our ≈øins upon the Cro≈ø≈øe; as the Goat bare the ≈øins of the people: So ≈øaies the Apo≈øtle, <hi>He him≈øelf bare our ≈øins upon the Cro≈øs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, He did not only bare our ≈øins upon the Cro≈øs: but (≈øaies the Apo≈øtle) <hi>he was made ≈øin for us.</hi> 'Tis not ≈øaid, He was made a ≈øinner, or accounted a ≈øinner only for us, but he was made ≈øin for us. All our iniquities were laid on him; he bare our ≈øins; and he was made ≈øin for us upon the Cro≈ø≈øe. Thus briefly the Second Propo≈øition is cleared, <hi>That when he did thus offer up him≈øelf upon the Cro≈ø≈øe as a ≈øacrifice, the ≈øins of all beleevers were then laid on him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>When the ≈øins of beleevers were laid on him,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>then he did make full ≈øatisfaction unto God the Father, and Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice for all our ≈øins.</hi> This is a bottom of much comfort. For if the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt our ≈øurety had not ≈øatisfied to the utmo≈øt farthing, our great Creditor, God the Father, for all our debts, God the Father might come upon us the Debters. But our Surety, the Lord Chri≈øt, hath given full ≈øatisfaction unto God the Father, that no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands can be made upon us: And indeed el≈øe, how could our Surety ever have come out of pri≈øon: He was under ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:162405:18"/>he was in the Jayle, in the grave: The Father, the great Creditor lets him out; and did not only let him out, but the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, he goes inbto Heaven, and ≈øits down there at the right hand of the Father; Surely, if the Creditor had not been ≈øatisfied, the Surety ≈øhould never have bin relea≈øed out of pri≈øon.</p>
               <p>He was ≈øo fully ≈øatisfied, That <hi>he looked for iniquity, and he found none,</hi> (≈øaies the text.) He look't over all his books, to ≈øee if he could find any thing upon the ≈øcore, but he found none: all our debts were paid. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the ≈øin of the world.</hi> He does not ≈øay, That takes away the ≈øin of the Jewes only; but takes away the ≈øin of the whole world. He does not ≈øay, That takes away the ≈øins, (in the plural Number) but takes away the <hi>≈øin</hi>) (in the ≈øingular Number:) Sins go ≈øo together, as if they were but one: but let the ≈øin be never ≈øo twi≈øted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as if it were but one ≈øin, this lamb of God, he takes away the ≈øin of the world. And he does not ≈øay, That hath pardoned the ≈øin of the World: for then a poor ≈øoul might ≈øay, I but, though he hath pardon'd my ≈øin, yet my ≈øin is not mortified. Neither does he ≈øay, Behold the lamb of God that Mortifies, or De≈øtroyes the ≈øin of the world: But he gives you a word, that takes in, both pardon, and Mortification too. Behold the lamb of God that takes them away: both in regard of Pardon, and in regard of Mortification: <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the ≈øin of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is nothing that does ≈øo ≈øatisfie God the Father, as Obedience, and the more full the Obedience is, the more God the Father is ≈øatisfied thereby: Now it is ≈øaid of our Lord and ≈øaviour Chri≈øt, That in this great ≈øacrifice upon the Cro≈ø≈øe, he was Obedient. <hi>He was Obedient even to the death of the Cro≈øs.</hi> That he that did make the Law, ≈øhould come down from Heaven, and be ≈øubject to the Law, what Obedience was here! <hi>Obedient to the Death.</hi> Yea, unto the <hi>Deaths</hi> (in the plural Number) And he made his grave with the ≈øinners: and his <hi>Deaths</hi> was with the rich. <hi>He made
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:162405:18"/>his grave with the wicked, and with the rich had his Deaths, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaiah,</hi> 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ver. 9. It is in the Plural Number in the Hebrew, though in your Engli≈øh tran≈ølation it is in the Singular. As if the holy Gho≈øt had called death, the Second death that our Lord Chri≈øt had in ≈øome mea≈øure ≈øuffered. For, if you con≈øider things truly, and rightly, I beleeve you will find, that our Lord and Saviour Chri≈øt when he died, and was in his agony, he did not only indure the fir≈øt, but the torments of the ≈øecond death. He overcame no more than he ≈øubmitted to: he overcame death by ≈øubmitting to death. Now he overcame the ≈øecond death al≈øo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ≈øome mea≈øure ≈øubmitted to the torments of it, ≈øo far as he was capable. Look what the fir≈øt <hi>Adam</hi> ≈øhould have indured for his ≈øin in the fall, that the ≈øecond <hi>Adam</hi> now did indure in ≈øome mea≈øure for to take it off: <hi>The day that thou eate≈øt thou ≈øhalt die the death.</hi> It was not barely the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and outward death, but it was the ≈øecond death. If our Lord and Saviour Chri≈øt did not indure the torments of the ≈øecond death, the wrath of God upon his ≈øoul; why did he ≈øweat drops of blood, and tremble, and ≈øhake ≈øo, when he came to die? There is many Saints, and Martyrs, when they come to die, they go skipping, and leaping, and rejoycing: and our Lord and Saviour, when he came to die, he ≈øweats drops of blood; ≈øurely there was more than an outward death: Oh! the wrath of God, and the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ≈øecond death was upon his ≈øoul. Thus obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent he was, and this obedience of his, it was volontary, for he needed not to have died; but he ≈øaw that God the father was di≈øhonoured by mans ≈øin, and that poor man would be lo≈øt, and rather than that ≈øhould be, he does volontarily offer him≈øelf unto this Obedience. <hi>Loe, I come</hi> (≈øaies he) <hi>in the volum of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, and thy Law is within my heart, P≈øal.</hi> 40.7, 8. Mark what an expre≈ø≈øion there is in that <hi>P≈øalm,</hi> 'tis ≈øpoken concering Chri≈øt, as is plainly interpreted by the Apo≈øtle in the 10. of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> at the 6. ver≈øe. <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou did≈øt not de≈øire, mine eares ha≈øt thou opened (or bored.)</hi> The Apo≈øtle
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:162405:19"/>when he tran≈ølates the≈øe words, he tran≈ølates them thus: <hi>My body ha≈øt thou prepared.</hi> But reade them as they are here in the <hi>P≈øalm: Sacrifice and offring thou did≈øt not de≈øire, mine eare hath thou bored.</hi> That as when a ≈øervant was willing to ≈øtay with his Ma≈øter, and to do him yet more ≈øervice, the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants eare was to be bored: So ≈øaies the Lord Chri≈øt, I am as willing to do this work, to be thus obedient, as a ≈øervant who≈øe eare is bored, is willing to ≈øtay with his ma≈øter: And mine eare ha≈øt thou bored, (≈øaies he) ah, here's obedience, here's obedience: this now did infinitly ≈øatisfie God the Father; In ≈øo much, that ye may ≈øee what is ≈øaid, in that ≈øame 5. of the <hi>Ephe≈øians,</hi> and the 2. ver≈øe. <hi>Who hath loved us, and given him≈øelf for us, an offering, and a ≈øacrifice to God for a ≈øweet ≈ømelling ≈øavour.</hi> The whol world it was ful of a ≈øtench before, and the Lord was di≈øplea≈øed with man before: but now when Chri≈øt comes, and offers up this ≈øacrifice, he did thereby give full ≈øatisfction unto God the father, for it was a ≈øweet ≈øwelling-≈øavour unto God the Father. So that thus the Father he was fully ≈øatisfied.</p>
               <p>To this I ≈øhall ad one word; <hi>When the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt offered up him≈øelf a ≈øacrifice unto God the Father, and had our ≈øins laid upon him, he did given more perfect ≈øatisfaction unto Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ju≈øtice for our ≈øins; than if you, and I, and all of us had been damned in Hell unto all eternity.</hi> For a Creditor is more ≈øatisfied, if his debt be paid him all down at once, than if it be paid by the week: A poor man that cannot pay all down, will pay a groat a week, or ≈øixpence a week; but 'tis more ≈øatisfaction to the Creditor to have all paid at once. Should we have been all damned, we ≈øhould have been but paying the debt a little, and a little, and a little: but when Chri≈øt paid it, he paid it all down to God the Father. Had we gone to Hell, and been damned for ever, we had alwaies been ≈øatisfying of God, I but God had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been ≈øatisfied: but now when Chri≈øt makes ≈øatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, God was ≈øatisfied. The Creditor, if he be a merciful and a good man, is more truly ≈øatisfied where the Debter is ≈øpared; he does not de≈øire that the Debter ≈øhould be ca≈øt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:162405:19"/>into pri≈øon, and there lie and rot; but he is better ≈øatisfied with the ≈øparing of the Debter; let me have but my Money, and ≈øo the Debter be ≈øpared I am willing, nay I de≈øire it ≈øaies the good Creditor. Now if all we had bin ca≈øt into everla≈øting burnings, indeed the debt ≈øhould have been a paying, but there the Debter had been lo≈øt: But not when Chri≈øt comes, and makes ≈øatisfaction unto Divine ju≈øtice, Ah! poor man is redeemed; here is the Debter ≈øpared. And therefore, the Lord he is infinitly more ≈øatisfied, by the ≈øatisfaction that Chri≈øt made upon the Cro≈øs for our ≈øins, than if all we had gone to Hell, and been damned to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. Oh! what a glorious, and ble≈ø≈øed ≈øatisfaction did this our High-Prie≈øt make unto God the Father!</p>

               <p>But the rea≈øon of it is this, Becau≈øe that men do not ≈øtudy this Truth, but was ignorant of it. As, ≈øuppo≈øe that a man do owe, three or four hundred pound to a ≈øhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, for wares, and commodities that he hath taken up there: a friend comes, and he payes the debt, cro≈ø≈øes the book: but the Debter, when he comes and looks upon the book, he is able to reade all the particulars; Item; for ≈øuch a thing, and Item for ≈øuch a thing, and Item, for ≈øuch a thing; but the man being not aquainted with the nature of cro≈ø≈øing the book, he is able to reade all th particulars, and he charges it ≈øtill upon him≈øelfe, becau≈øe he does not under≈øtand the nature of this cro≈ø≈øing the book, and he is as much troubled how he ≈øhall pay the debt, as if it were

Yea, that ≈øacrifice, that was then in the times of the old-Te≈øtament, it could not purge the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience; not only, becau≈øe (as the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks) it was the blood of bulls, and goats: but becau≈øe the ≈øacrifice was performed ≈øucce≈ø≈øively; as thus, A man ≈øinned, then he brought a ≈øacrifice; ≈øins again, and then he brings another ≈øicrifice: and once every yeare, the High-Prie≈øt goes into the holy of holie≈øt to make an atonement: But in the mean while, a poor ≈øoul might think thus, What if I die before the year come about, what will become of me? the High-Prie≈øt, he goes once a year into the Holy of Holye≈øt, and ≈øprinkles the mercy-≈øeat, but what will become of me if I die before that time? But now, our great High-Prie≈øt, he does not only offer up a ≈øacrifice, and Him≈øelf the ≈øacrifice; but he offers up a ≈øacrifice <hi>once</hi> for all. (So ≈øaies the Apo≈øtle) So that now, when a Chri≈øtian hath ≈øinned, he is not to think of a ≈øacrifice that is yet to come, a year hence, but he is to look unto that which is done already, a ≈øacrifice <hi>once offered,</hi> and <hi>once for all;</hi> So that he needs not be in ≈øu≈øpence now, as the Jewes were, his Con≈øcience, it may be fully purged from ≈øin.</p>

               <p>Again, Take the High-Prie≈øt in the times of the old-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtament, and though he did make an atonement for the ≈øins of the people;yet ≈øometimes al≈øo he did make the people to ≈øin. It is ≈øaid of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the great <hi>High-Prie≈øt,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the golden-Calf, that he did make the <hi>people naked:</hi> But the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, our great High-Prie≈øt, he makes an attonement for ≈øin, and never does make them ≈øin: He is ≈øo far from making the people naked, that he covers them with his righteou≈øne≈øs that their nakedne≈øs may not appear. Here's a glorious High-Prie≈øt!</p>
               <p>Yea, This High-Prie≈øt of ours, He does not only make an atonement for ≈øin committed, and paies the debt; but he does al≈øo become our Surety unto God the Father: He does not only pay the debt that is pa≈øt, but he becomes a Surety for time to come. None of all tho≈øe High-Prie≈øts, that ever did ≈øo; not <hi>Aaron,</hi> not any High-Prie≈øt that ever gave his bond unto God the Father, that any ≈øinner ≈øhould never ≈øin no more. But our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, our High-Prie≈øt, he becomes our Surety: and what Surety? not an ordinary ≈øurety; for among≈øt us, the Surety joyns, and does become bound with the Debter, but ≈øtill it runs in the name of the Debter, and the Debter he gives the bond for to pay the debt. But now here, our Surety, he gives the bond, and we that are the Debters, we do not give the bond for to pay the debt: there is no godly man, or beleever, that ever gave a bond unto God the Father, that he will pay the debt: but our Surety comes, and the bond goes in the name of the Surety, and the Debters name is out. Oh! what a glorious, and ble≈ø≈øed High-Prie≈øt is here! here is a High-Prie≈øt, beyond all the High-Prie≈øts that ever did go before! And that's the Fourth thing</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:162405:24"/>your Prayers, Reading, Meditation, they are all the fruit of Chri≈øt: The injoyment of al his Ordinances, &amp; al your ≈øpiritual priviledges under the Go≈øpel, they are the fruit of Chri≈øt. Now ≈øaies ≈øhe, <hi>I ≈øate down under his ≈øhadow, and his fruit, it was ≈øweet unto my ta≈øt.</hi> As it is unto a man that does love fruit; be it Pears, Apples, Cherries, or the like: I love this fruit (≈øaies he) but yet notwith≈øtanding, I mu≈øt needs go where this fruit grows, and gather it off the tree; and when he hath gone to the tree, and taken the fruit off the tree, (≈øaies he) I ≈øate down under the tree. I had not the fruit, the Apple, or Cherry, brought unto my hou≈øe, but I went unto the tree, and gathered it off the tree; and I ≈øate down under the ≈øhadow of the tree, and Oh! how ≈øweet was the fruit unto me! So ≈øaies the ≈øoul, ≈øo ≈øaies the Spou≈øe of Je≈øus Chri≈øt: I ≈øate down under the ≈øhadow of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and then his fruit was ≈øweet unto my ta≈øt. It may be we have had other ≈øhadows: we have ≈øate down under the ≈øhadow of our E≈øtate, our outward E≈øtate hath been ≈øweet unto our ta≈øt. We have ≈øate down (it may be) under the ≈øhadow of friend≈øhip, and the fruit of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip hath been ≈øweet unto our ta≈øt; But behold here a tree, the tree of life, who≈øe ≈øhadow reaches to the end of the earth; Ah, Come, Come and ≈øit down under the ≈øhadow of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. If there be ever a poor ≈øoul, that never yet knew what Comfort meant; Ah, Come, Come under the ≈øhadow of the Lord Je≈øus; The Prie≈øtly Office of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, it hath a very ≈øweet ≈øhadow; Come therefore, you that ≈øay you cannot profit under the means, and you that complain of ≈øuch, and ≈øuch temptations, and ≈øuch and ≈øuch ≈øins; and that you were never yet comforted, your con≈øciences never pacified: Come now, and ≈øit down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ≈øhadow of the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt. I tell thee, from the Lord, thus fruit of His, it ≈øhall be ≈øweet unto thy ta≈øt: thou ≈øhalt go to Prayer, and Prayer ≈øhall be ≈øweet unto thy ≈øoul, though heretofore thou could≈øt find no ≈øweetne≈øs in it; ≈øo the Word and other Ordinances ≈øhall be ≈øweeter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee than the hony or the hony combe.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:162405:25"/>
               <p>Thus it's evident how comfortable the Prie≈øtly Office of Je≈øus Chri≈øts, and how much conducing unto our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and Holine≈øs: Oh! therefore let us ≈øtudy, now ≈øtudy the Prie≈øtly Office of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and come and ≈øit down under his ≈øhadow, and the Lord make his fruit ≈øweet unto all our ≈øouls.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have begun to di≈øcover from the≈øe words, That the Frie≈øtly Office of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, is the great Magazine, and Storehou≈øe, of all that grace, and comfort which we have in this world: that whereby we are ≈øuccoured, and relieved again≈øt all Temptations. This hath been made good in the <hi>Generall;</hi> and in <hi>one Particular</hi> work of the High Prie≈øt.</p>
               <p>If we now inquire further, what the work of the High-Prie≈øt was, and is, that accordingly we may addre≈øs our ≈øelves unto Je≈øus Chri≈øt for ≈øuccour. We ≈øhall find, that it is al≈øo, to <hi>Pray,</hi> and <hi>Intercede</hi> for the people. <hi>To make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for the ≈øins of the people,</hi> (≈øaies the text) <hi>To make A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for the ≈øins of the people,</hi> (≈øaies the old Te≈øtament.) Which <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> or <hi>Atonement,</hi> was made in the times of the old Te≈øtament, not only by offering of a ≈øacrifice, but by taking the blood thereof, and pre≈øenting that with Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:162405:26"/>and interce≈ø≈øions, unto God, to accept of it for the ≈øins of the people. As we ≈øhall find, in that ≈øame 16. of <hi>Livitieus:</hi> After the ≈øacrifice was kild, the Prie≈øt was to take the blood of it, and ≈øprinkle it with his finger upon the Mercy-Seat; as we reade in the 14. ver≈øe. And at the 12. and 13. <hi>He ≈øhall take a Cen≈øer full of burning coals of fire from off the Alter before the Lord, and his hands full of ≈øweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen≈øe beaten ≈ømall, and bring it within the vaile; And he ≈øhall put the incen≈øe upon the fire before the Lord, that the cloud of the incen≈øe may cover the Mercy-Seat.</hi> He was to cau≈øe a cloud of incen≈øe to ari≈øe upon the Mercy-Seat. All which was a great Type of the Prayers, and Interce≈ø≈øions of Je≈øus Chri≈øt: who having once offered up him≈øelf a ≈øacrifice for our ≈øins, hath carried the blood, and the vertue of it into Heaven, there ≈øprinkled the Mercy-Seat, and there ≈øtill by his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øions does appear for us; As it is proved at large, in the 9. Chapter of this Epi≈øtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> 11. and 12 ver≈øes: <hi>But Chri≈øt being come an High-Prie≈øt of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to ≈øay, not of this building: Neither by the blood of goats and calves: but by his own blood be entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternall redemption for us.</hi> And at the 24. ver≈øe: <hi>For Chri≈øt is not entered into the Holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into Heaven it ≈øelf, now to appear in the pre≈øence of God for us.</hi> And if you duely con≈øider this book of the Hebrews, you will find, that this work of Chri≈øts Interce≈ø≈øion, is The E≈ø≈øential work of his Prie≈øtly-Office: it ≈øeems rather to go beyond the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, than to fall ≈øhort of it. <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the 8. Chapter and the 4. ver≈øe. <hi>For if he were on earth, he ≈øhould not be a Prie≈øt.</hi> That is, look as it was in the times of the old Te≈øtament: if the Prie≈øt had only offered a ≈øacrifice, and had not gone into the holy of holie≈øt with the blood thereof, ≈øprinkling the Mercy-Seat, praying, and interceding that it might be accepted for the ≈øins of the people, the Prie≈øt had not done the work of the Prie≈øt, and ≈øo he had not been a compleat Prie≈øt: So now, (≈øaies the Apo≈øtle) if Je≈øus Chri≈øt had only
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:162405:26"/>offred up him≈øelf here a ≈øacrifice, and had not gone into Heaven, the holy of holie≈øt, and carried the power and the vertue of his death thither, to pray and intercede for us, he had not done the work of the great High-Prie≈øt. Every Prie≈øt might ≈øacrifice, but every Prie≈øt might not go into the Holy of Holie≈øt, that belonged only to the High-Prie≈øt to do. Now therefore, Je≈øus Chri≈øt going into Heaven, the Holy of Holie≈øt, there to make Interce≈ø≈øion for us, is the great, and the ≈øpecial work of this High-Prie≈øt.</p>

                  <hi>Fir≈øt it con≈øi≈øts in this:</hi> His appearing for us in Heaven, his owning of our Cau≈øe, and of our ≈øouls to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: It is the word that is u≈øed in that 9. Chapter of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the 24. ver≈øe. <hi>Chri≈øt is not entred into the holy place made with hands, but into Heaven, now to appear in the pre≈øence of God for us.</hi> He does not in an ordinary way, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner appear for us in Heaven; but with an <hi>Empha≈øis,</hi> he does openly, and publickly, before all the Saints and Angels, appear for us in the pre≈øence of God the Father. It is a comfort unto a man, ≈øometimes, to have a good friend at Court, at the Kings elbow, that may own him, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for him: but though a man have a friend at Court, ≈øometimes if there be any danger, he will not appear, and own a man; it may be he will own him, and countenance
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:162405:27"/>his Cau≈øe as long as there is no danger, but no longer. But now, here, we have a friend in Heaven, that will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for us, and own our Cau≈øes, and our ≈øouls, and in all conditions appear for us. That is the Fir≈øt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>2</label> He doth not only appear for us; but by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Prie≈øtly Office, he does carry the power, merit, and vertue of his blood into the pre≈øence of God the Father in Heaven, and ≈øprinkles the Mercy-Seat with it ≈øeven times. Seven is a note of Perfection. Tho≈øe that Chri≈øt ≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for, he does Intercede for. He takes all their bonds, and he carries them in unto God the Father, and he ≈øaies, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I have paid the≈øe bonds, I have paid this debt, I have ≈øatisfied thy Ju≈øtice for the≈øe poor ≈øinners; and now my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire is, that they may be acquitted from the≈øe bonds, and from the≈øe debts. This al≈øo is remarkable in that 9. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> 11, 12. ver≈øes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>3</label> He doth not only carry the power, and vertue of his blood, and pre≈øent it to God the Father for our di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge: but he does al≈øo plead our Cau≈øe in Heaven, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwering unto all tho≈øe accu≈øations that are brought again≈øt us. And therefore we may reade what the Apo≈øtle ≈øaies in the 8. of the <hi>Rom.</hi> 33. ver. <hi>Who ≈øhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that ju≈øtifies, who is he that condemneth? it is Chri≈øt that died, yea, rather that he is ri≈øen again, who is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at the right hand of God, who al≈øo maketh interce≈ø≈øion for us.</hi> Upon this ground the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks thus; Who ≈øhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them? Je≈øus Chri≈øt is at the right hand of God the Father, to take off all accu≈øations, that ≈øhall be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt them. Let the World condemn, let <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> condemn, let Satan condemn; Je≈øus Chri≈øt is at the right hand of God the Father, to take off all accu≈øations that ≈øhall be rai≈øed again≈øt them. Concerning this there is a clear and full in≈øtance in that notable Scripture the 3. Chapter of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah,</hi> and the 1. ver≈øe, We find Satan ≈øtanding at the right hand of <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> to re≈øi≈øt him. <hi>He ≈øhewed me</hi> Jo≈øhua <hi>the High-Prie≈øt, ≈øtanding before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan ≈øtanding at his right band to re≈øi≈øt him.</hi> It was the cu≈øtome of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:162405:27"/>the Accu≈øer, to ≈øtand at the right hand of the accu≈øed: <hi>P≈øalme,</hi> 109. ver. 6. <hi>Set thou a wicked man over him, and let Satan ≈øtand at his right hand:</hi> take the wall of him in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øation, condemning of him. Now here Satan-≈øtanding at <hi>Jo≈øhua's</hi> right hand, notes his accu≈øing of him. Well, what was the matter that he accu≈øed him of? Ye ≈øhall find that there was matter, ver≈øe the 3. <hi>Now</hi> Jo≈øhua <hi>was cloathed with filthy garments, and ≈øtood before the Angel.</hi> Satan came and accu≈øed him that he had filthy garments; and ≈øo he had: for the Prie≈øts, had defiled them≈øelves in Babylon, in marrying of ≈øtrange wives, as <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> and his children are charged, in the 10. Chapter of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the 18. ver≈øe. (Give me leave a little to open this charge of Satan, that we may ≈øee Satan had matter of Charge, and accu≈øation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi>) <hi>And among the ≈øons of the Prie≈øts, there were found that had taken ≈øtrange wives: namely of the ≈øons of</hi> Jo≈øhua. <hi>He was High-Prie≈øt.</hi> So that now, <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> had defiled his garments: thre was then matter of accu≈øation for Satan to work upon. But now, our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, our great High-Prie≈øt ≈øteps in, and takes off this accu≈øation: The Lord ≈øaid (at the 3. of <hi>Zachariah,</hi> 2. ver≈øe) unto Satan, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, even the Lord that hath cho≈øen Jeru≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem rebuke thee.</hi> The word u≈øed by the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> is the ≈øame that is u≈øed for Excommunication. And it is here twice repeated, <hi>(The Lord rebuke thee, even the Lord rebuke thee)</hi> not only to ≈øhow the fulne≈ø≈øe of Satans rebuke; but to ≈øhow the fulne≈ø≈øe of the interce≈ø≈øion of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Now would we ≈øee the fulne≈ø≈øe of Chri≈øts apology for <hi>Jo≈øhua?</hi> Saies the Lord unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, even the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke thee: And (≈øaies he at the latter end of the 2. ver≈øe) <hi>Is not this a brand pluck't out of the fire?</hi> Thus; it is true Lord, that <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> hath filthy garments: but yet notwith≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> is but as a brand pluck't newly out of the burning. Take a brand, and pull it newly out of the fire, and there will be du≈øt, a≈øhes, and dirt about it. Lord (≈øaies he) <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> is but newly puld out of the burning, and therefore, Lord, he mu≈øt needs have ≈øome a≈øhes, and ≈øome
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:162405:28"/>dirt, and ≈øome filth about him: O Lord, (≈øaies Chri≈øt) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> be clothed with filthy garments, I will take away tho≈øe filthy garments: ver≈øe the 4. <hi>He an≈øwered and ≈øpake unto tho≈øe that ≈øtood before him ≈øaying, Take away the filthy garments from him: and unto him he ≈øaid, Behold, I have cau≈øed thine iniquity to pa≈ø≈øe from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.</hi> This can be none but Chri≈øt. Thus Chri≈øt takes off the accu≈øation that was brought again≈øt <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> by <hi>Satan,</hi> for his filthy garments. And ≈øo does the Lord Chri≈øt now: If a poor ≈øoul fall into any ≈øin, defile his garments: Satan, he comes in, and takes the right hand of him, ≈øtands at the right hand and accu≈øes, by rea≈øon of this filthy garment: but our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, our great High-Prie≈øt, he being at the right hand of the Father, takes up the cau≈øe, and an≈øwers to the accu≈øation: True Lord, this poor ≈øoul, indeed hath filthy garments; but he is but as a fire-brand pluck't newly out of the burning: He was in his natural, and ≈øinful condition the other day, in his burning, and he is but newly changed, and therefore he mu≈øt needs have ≈øome dirt, and ≈øome filth upon him, as a fire-brand pluck't out of the burning; and therefore con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him in that re≈øpect, and though he have filthy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments now upon him; yet I will give him change of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and take away his filthy garments. Thus the Lord Chri≈øt ≈øteps in to God the Father, and an≈øwers to all tho≈øe accu≈øations that are brought again≈øt him to God the Father. This is the Third thing that he does by way of his Interce≈ø≈øion.</p>
               <p>Again, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>4</label> He doth not only plead our Cau≈øe, and take off accu≈øations that are brought again≈øt us: But he does al≈øo, call for Ab≈øolution, and for Pardon of poor ≈øinners, at the hand of God the Father, in a way of ju≈øtice and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: And therefore he is called,<note place="margin">1 <hi>John,</hi> 2.1.</note> 
                  <hi>our Advocate: If any man ≈øin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Je≈øus Chri≈øt the righteous.</hi> The work of an Advocate, differs from the work of a Petitioner: an Advocate does not Petition the Judge, but an Advocate, he tels the Judge what is Law,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:162405:28"/>what is right, &amp; what ought to be done. So the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt being in Heaven, and making Interce≈ø≈øion, is there as our Advocate: Lord (≈øaies he) this man he hath ≈øinned indeed, but I have ≈øatisfyed for his ≈øins, I have paid for them to the full, I have ≈øatisfied thy wrath to the ful: now therefore, in a way of Equity, and in a way of Ju≈øtice, I do here call for this mans pardon: Thus Chri≈øt intercedes.

Shall <hi>Abigail,</hi> a woman, a ≈øtranger prevail thus with <hi>David</hi> for a <hi>Nabal?</hi> and ≈øhall not the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, the Son of the Father, not a ≈øtranger, nor a ≈øtranger to his bo≈øome, but beloved from everla≈øting, ≈øhall not be prevaile much more, when he comes, and pleads the cau≈øe of the Elect, and of the Children of God, in the pre≈øence of God the Father, whom the Father loves al≈øo? Great is the Rhetorick of a Child: if a Child do but cry, Father, e≈øpecially if the child be a wi≈øe child, he may prevail much with a tender hearted father. The Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, he is the Son of the Father, and he is the Wi≈ødom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too; and God the Father is a tender hearted father: Oh! ≈øurely therefore, Powerful are the Interce≈ø≈øions of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt with God the Father.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The prevalency of Chri≈øts Interce≈ø≈øions with the Father, will appear: if we con≈øider, The inclination, and di≈øpo≈øition, that God the Father hath, unto the ≈øame things that Chri≈øt prayeth, and intercedeth for. If a child ≈øhould come, and intreat his father, in a matter that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:162405:29"/>the father hath no mind to, or that the father is ≈øet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt; po≈ø≈øibly he might not prevail: But if a beloved child ≈øhall come and pray the father, in a bu≈øine≈øs that the father likes as well as the child; ≈øurely then, the child is very like to ≈øpeed. Thus it is: The Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt comes, and he intercedes for us: and the Father hath as great an inclination, and di≈øpo≈øition unto the work that Chri≈øt intercedes for, as Chri≈øt him≈øelf hath: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øaies Chri≈øt, <hi>Loe, I come to do thy will: I come not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ≈øent me.</hi> That which Chri≈øt did, that he had a mind to, it was rather, the will of the Father, than Chri≈øts will: the Father is as ≈øtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, and di≈øpo≈øed to what Chri≈øt did, and wils, as Chri≈øt him≈øelf. <hi>Tho≈øe that thou ha≈øt given me</hi> (≈øaies he) <hi>I have lo≈øt none:</hi> they are thine own, Lord, and therefore I pray for them. We have a notable expre≈ø≈øion to this end, in the 10. Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> and the 17. ver≈øe. <hi>Therefore doth my father love me, becau≈øe I lay down my life, that I may take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. I lay down my life:</hi> Here's his ≈øuffering, and his ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. <hi>That I may take it again:</hi> Go up to Heaven, and take it again and intercede. <hi>Therefore doth my father love me.</hi> Oh! what a round of love is here: God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of love, ≈øends Chri≈øt into the world to die for man: <hi>God ≈øo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.</hi> Wel, Je≈øus Chri≈øt out of love to us, he dies for us: Who hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, and given him≈øelf for us. The Father loves the world in giving Chri≈øt, The Son loves the world in dying for us; and the Father, he loves Chri≈øt again, for loving us: Chri≈øt loves us, and the Father loves Chri≈øt again for loving of us: a mighty high expre≈ø≈øion, That the Father ≈øhould love Chri≈øt, for loving us. So then look wherein the love of Chri≈øt is ≈øeen unto poor ≈øinners, the Fathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and di≈øpo≈øition is untot hat as much as Chri≈øts: So that when he comes unto God the Father, and does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede, he mu≈øt needs prevail, becau≈øe the Father loves him for his interceding, the Father likes the matter as well as he, loves you the better for it.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:162405:30"/>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> This will appear al≈øo, if we con≈øider, upon what termes our Lord and Saviour Chri≈øt, our great High-Prie≈øt, was taken, and admitted into Heaven, the Holy of Holie≈øt: ≈øo it is called. He was Honourably received into Heaven, and he ws received thither, for to do the work of the High-Prie≈øt. He was Honourably received when he came to Heaven: <hi>Sit thou down at my right hand</hi> (≈øaies God the Father to him) a note of Honour. When <hi>Solomon</hi> would expre≈ø≈øe his Honour to his mother, he ≈øet her down at his right hand. Thus God the Father would expre≈ø≈øe the Honourable welcome that Chri≈øt had when he came to Heaven: Sit thou down on my right hand (≈øaies he.) Now ye ≈øhall ob≈øerve, that when ≈øoever this is made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, The ≈øitting down at the right hand of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it is made mention of, not with the Kingly Office of Chri≈øt, but with the Prie≈øtly Office of Chri≈øt: as if that he were ≈øet down there, to do the work of the Prie≈øtly Office: One would think (I ≈øay) that this ≈øhould be expre≈øt with the Kingly Office of Chri≈øt: but you ≈øhall find it running along in the Scripture, ≈øtill with the Prie≈øtly Office of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Look into the 8. Chapter of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the 1. ver≈øe. Now of the things which we have ≈øpoken, this is the ≈øum: <hi>We have ≈øuch an High-Prie≈øt, who is ≈øet on the right hand of the Throne, of the Maje≈øty in the Heavens.</hi> It's named with the Prie≈øtly Office. And ≈øo again, in the 10. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> at the 11. and 12. ver≈øes. <hi>Every High-Prie≈øt ≈øtandeth dayly mini≈øtring, and offering often times the ≈øame ≈øacrifices, which can never take away ≈øin: But this man,</hi> (≈øpeaking of Chri≈øt) <hi>after he had offered one ≈øacrifice for ≈øins for ever, ≈øate down on the right hand of God:</hi> It is carried a long with the mention of the Prie≈øtly Office of Chri≈øt: as if he were ≈øate down on the right hand of God the Father in Heaven, on purpo≈øe to do the work of the Prie≈øtly Office. When Je≈øus Chri≈øt came into Heaven, into the Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie≈øt, he came thither as our great High-Prie≈øt; and he ≈øaid unto God the Father; Lord, I am not now come in mine own name, for my own ≈øake only, but I come as the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:162405:30"/>great High-Prie≈øt, having on this Bre≈øt-plate, the name of all the Elect; and I come to intercede for poor ≈øinners; I come as High-Prie≈øt: Saies God the Father to him, Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come upon tho≈øe termes, welcome upon tho≈øe termes, not wich ≈øtanding thou doe≈øt come in their names, come and ≈øit down at my right hand, ≈øaies God the Father to him: Thus Father is ingaged, for he received him upon tho≈øe termes into Heaven, as our great High-Prie≈øt; the Father therefore is engaged to hear his Interce≈ø≈øion, and ≈øo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terce≈ø≈øion of Je≈øus-Chri≈øt, mu≈øt have a great deal of power, and prevalency with God the Father in Heaven. This is the Second thing.</p>
               <p>But, Thirdly, <hi>Does the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt intercede for us in Heaven, as our great High-Prie≈øt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes, and he does do this, in a more tran≈øcendent, and eminent way and manner, than ever any High-Prie≈øt did before Him.</p>
               <p>For Fir≈øt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> He hath gone through more Temptations than ever any High-Prie≈øt did. <hi>He was tempted</hi> (≈øaies the text) <hi>that he might ≈øuccour tho≈øe that are temped, as an High-Prie≈øt:</hi> If he was Tempted, that he might ≈øuccour tho≈øe that are Tempted; ≈øuccour them as an High-Prie≈øt, then the more he was Tempted, the more experimentally able he is for to ≈øuccour tho≈øe that are Tempted. Never any High-Prie≈øt, that was Tempted like unto Chri≈øt. <hi>He was</hi> (≈øaies the Apo≈øtle) <hi>in all things tempted, like unto us, ≈øin only excepted.</hi> Poor ≈øoul, name any temptation, that thy heart is ≈øcared at the thoughts of, and you will find, that the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, he was tempted with that temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. You will ≈øay, I am often times tempted to doubt Whether I be the Child of God or no, and that very often. So was Chri≈øt too: you know the place in the 4. of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew: If thou be the Son of God; and if thou be the Son of God,</hi> twice that the Devil would ≈øet an <hi>If</hi> upon Chri≈øts Son-≈øhip. Oh! but I am tempted often times to u≈øe indirect means to get out of trouble. So was Chri≈øt too: <hi>Command that the≈øe ≈øtones be made bread,</hi> ≈øaies the Devil to him. Oh! but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:162405:31"/>≈øometimes I have been tempted, even to lay violent hands upon my ≈øelf. So did the Devil tempt Chri≈øt too; <hi>Ca≈øt thy ≈øelf down off the pinacle of the Temple;</hi> that was a temptation. Oh! but I am tempted unto ≈øuch evil things, that truely I am afraid to ≈øpeak of, ≈øuch Bla≈øphemies, ≈øuch horrid, and wretched Bla≈øphemies, as I think never came upon the heart of any child of God, ≈øo that I am afraid to think of them, and a≈øhamed to mention them. And was not Chri≈øt ≈øo? was not he tempted ≈øo? Saies the Devil to him, <hi>All this will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and wor≈øhip me.</hi> Oh! horrid Bla≈øphemy! Blu≈øh, blu≈øh, O Sun: that the Lord Je≈øus, the God of glory, ≈øhould fall down to the Devil, and wor≈øhip the Devil; what wretched bla≈øphemy was here, that he ≈øhould ≈øpeak this? and yet the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, he was tempted to it. What ≈øhall I ≈øay, He was in all things tempted like unto us, ≈øin only excepted. Now, there was never any High-Prie≈øt that was ≈øo tempted, and he was therefore tempted, that he might ≈øuccour tho≈øe that are tempted. He is more able as our High-Prie≈øt to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, to put in for you, and to ≈øuccour you, than ever any High-Prie≈øt was before him.</p>
               <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As he hath gone through more Temptations than ever any High-Prie≈øt did: So al≈øo, he is filled with more Compa≈ø≈øions. It behoved the High-Prie≈øt to be Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful: it is an office of love, and Mercy. Now our Lord and Saviour Chri≈øt (≈øaies the Apo≈øtle) is ≈øuch an High-Prie≈øt, as cannot but be touched with your infirmities: the High-Prie≈øt that did go before him, ≈øometimes, was not touched with their infirmities: <hi>Hannah</hi> came and prayed, and <hi>Eli's</hi> heart was not touched with her infirmity, at the fir≈øt. But our High-Prie≈øt cannot but be touched, he does ≈øympathize with us under all our infirmities. He is affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in all our afflictions. It was the work of the High-Prie≈øt to ≈øympathize with the people; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding, there was a law, that the High-Prie≈øt might not mourn for his kindred, in that he might not, as others, ≈øympathize, or mourn. But now, our Lord Je≈øus, he does
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:162405:31"/>fully ≈øympathize with us, and therefore goes beyond all the High-Prie≈øts that ever was before him.</p>
               <p>Further, He is more faithful in his office, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and place than ever any High-Prie≈øt was. <hi>Aaron</hi> was an High-Prie≈øt, butunfaithful in the matter of the golden calfe. But our Lord and Saviour Chri≈øt, he is more faithful than <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> was, In this 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. ver≈øes, (and ≈øo on.) <hi>Wherefore ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brethren, con≈øider the Apo≈øtle and High-Prie≈øt of our profe≈ø≈øion Chri≈øt Je≈øus, who was faithful to him that appointed him, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo</hi> Mo≈øes <hi>was faithful in all his hou≈øe.</hi> He ≈øteps over <hi>Aaron,</hi> who was the the High-Prie≈øt, and he compares him here to <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> in faithfulne≈øs. Now <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> was faithful in all his hou≈øe: But our Lord and Saviour here, he is preferred before <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> in point of faithfulne≈øs; yet it is ≈øaid, Mo≈øes <hi>was faithful in all his hou≈øe.</hi> When that the Lord comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> any thing, as the Lord commanded ≈øo did he, and ro≈øe up early in the morning to do the commandement of God: He was faithful in all his hou≈øe; and yet our Lord and Saviour was more faithful than <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Prie≈øthood. For ≈øo it is brought in here, at the 3. ver≈øe. <hi>For this man was counted worthy of more glory than</hi> Mo≈øes, <hi>in as much as be who hath builded the hou≈øe, hath more honour than the hou≈øe.</hi> Ver≈øe the 5. Mo≈øes <hi>verily was faithful in all his hou≈øe, as a ≈øervant, for a te≈øtimony of tho≈øe things which were to be ≈øpoken after; but Chri≈øt as a Son over his own hou≈øe.</hi> Look now, as a Child, or a ≈øon is more faithful in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hou≈øe than a ≈øervant will be: ≈øo, (≈øaies the Apo≈øtle) <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> is more faithful than <hi>Mo≈øes.</hi> And look as the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the hou≈øe, does go beyond, and excel every beam, and ≈øtone in the hou≈øe, or every part of the building: So does the Lord Chri≈øt in faithfulne≈øs, exceed <hi>Mo≈øes.</hi> You will ≈øay, there is a great difference between a ≈øtone in the building, and the maker of the hou≈øe: Look what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is between a ≈øtone, or a piece of wood, &amp; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the building! ≈øo great a difference there is (≈øaies the Apo≈øtle) between Je≈øus Chri≈øt, in the matter of his <hi>Prie≈øthood,</hi> and <hi>Mo≈øes;</hi> yet notwith≈øtanding, <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> is faithful in all his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:162405:32"/>hou≈øe. Oh! then, how faithful is Je≈øus Chri≈øt, in the matter of his Prie≈øthood! He goes before all that ever went before him.</p>
               <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Take other High-Prie≈øts, and though they were never ≈øo good, they could not alwaies intercede, they died; the High-Prie≈øt died, and another came in his room: But this man liveth for ever to make Interce≈ø≈øion.</p>
               <p>Yea, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Take the High-prie≈øt in the times of the old-Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and while he lived, he did not alwaies intercede for the people: Once in a year, the High-prie≈øt came to enter into the Holy of Holie≈øt to ≈øprinkle the Mercy-≈øeat with blood, and cau≈øed a cloud to ari≈øe upon the Mercy-≈øeat, with his prayers, and interce≈ø≈øions for their acceptance: and then he went out of the Holy of Holie≈øt, and laid a≈øide his garments. But now, our great High-prie≈øt, is a≈øcended into the Holy of Holie≈øt never to put off his Prie≈øtly gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and he does not once a year ≈øprinkle the Mercy-≈øeat with his ≈øacrifice, but every day: and therefore he goes beyond all the High-prie≈øts that ever went before him.</p>
               <p>And yet further: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Take the High-prie≈øt in the old Law, in the times of the old Te≈øtament: and though they did offer ≈øacrifice for ≈øome ≈øinnes, and intercede; yet there was other ≈øins again, that no ≈øacrifice was to be offered for.

               <p>Secondly, Who tho≈øe are, that the Lord Chri≈øt does Intercede for in Heaven.</p>
               <p>And Thirdly, How willing, how infinitely willing he is to Intercede for us: that ≈øo I may bring the comfort neerer to our own bo≈øomes.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I ≈øay it is no Pre≈øumption for us to bear our ≈øelves upon the Interce≈ø≈øion of Je≈øus Chri≈øt: no Pre≈øumption to beleeve. We know the ≈øtory of the woman in the Go≈øpel, that came unto our Lord and Saviour, touching the hem of his garment for her cure, and ≈øhe was cured thereby. But our Saviour perceiving vertue to be gone from him, he cals out the per≈øon, <hi>Who hath touched me? come forth;</hi> and the woman came forth trembling. Our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chri≈øt, does not ≈øay to this poor woman, How dare you thus touch me? how dur≈øt you thus pre≈øume to do it? Con≈øider, The woman had no Command to do it, no Precept to back her: The woman had no promi≈øe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage her; that if ≈øhee did touch the hem of his garment, ≈øhe ≈øhould be cured. The woman had no Example; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any before that touched the hem of his garment and was cured: No Commandement, No Promi≈øe, No Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Surely now, if any woman, or man, ≈øhould Pre≈øume, it ≈øhould be this woman, that had no Commandement,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:162405:34"/>nor no Promi≈øe, nor no Example; and yet the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt does not chide her away, does not tell her, ≈øhe had pre≈øumed; but, <hi>O woman thy faith hath ≈øaved thee, thy faith hath made the whole.</hi> Let me ≈øpeake this home, we have a Command now to beleeve in Chri≈øt; and a Promi≈øe: Tho≈øe that come unto him, he ever liveth to make Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øion for them: And we have Examples of many that have come unto Je≈øus Chri≈øt, born them≈øelves upon his Interce≈ø≈øion, and have gone away cured: what! was it no Pre≈øumption for the woman to come and touch Chri≈øt, without a Commandement, and a Promi≈øe, and an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? and have you Examples, and have you Promi≈øes, and have you Commandements to beleeve, and will you ≈øay this is Pre≈øumption? Be not deceived, it is no Pre≈øumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for thee, poor ≈øoul, to bear thy ≈øelf at length upon Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> To make this out a little more fully: I ≈øhall di≈øcover who tho≈øe are that the Interce≈ø≈øion of Je≈øus Chri≈øt does belong unto.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1</note> 
                  <hi>If any man ≈øin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Je≈øus Chri≈øt the righteous.</hi> You will ≈øay, This is to be carried upon tho≈øe that were ≈øpoke of before: and tho≈øe were ≈øuch as had fellow≈øhip with the Father: <hi>Truely, our fellow≈øhip is with the Father, and with his Sonne Je≈øus Chri≈øt;</hi> Chap. 1. ver≈øe 3. <hi>Now if any man ≈øin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Je≈øus Chri≈øt the righteous.</hi> If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man that hath fellow≈øhip with the Father, or Chri≈øt, ≈øin; they have an Advocate with God the Father. Fir≈øt therefore ≈øtand you by I pray, that we will take for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, all you that ever had any fellow≈øhip with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or with Je≈øus Chri≈øt; this Doctrine of the Interce≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and the comfort hereof does belong to you.</p>
               <p>Moreover, In the 17. Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> there we find, that our Saviour ≈øaies, He prayes for tho≈øe that do beleeve, and ≈øhould beleeve. Tho≈øe that he prayes for here, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes for in Heaven: <hi>Neither pray I for the≈øe alone</hi> (at the 20. ver≈øe) <hi>but for them al≈øo which ≈øhall beleeve on me through thy

               <p>But now yet further, If we look into the 7. Chapter of this Epi≈øtle unto the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> at the 25. ver≈øe, we ≈øhall find the≈øe words: <hi>Wherefore, he is able al≈øo, to ≈øave them to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt, that come unto God by him, ≈øeeing he ever liveth to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terce≈ø≈øion for them.</hi> Who are tho≈øe?

                  <hi>There is one thing that makes me afraid he will not intercede for me, I have been ≈øo great a tran≈øgre≈ø≈øor: for I have been a tran≈øgre≈ø≈øor again≈øt Je≈øus Chri≈øt, this High-Prie≈øt: Oh!

               <p>But now, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> this may be more fully made out to us, if we do but take in the Third thing, and that is: <hi>The Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt, he is infinitely willing to intercede for us.</hi> We have ≈øeen who tho≈øe are unto whom the Interce≈ø≈øion of Chri≈øt belongs: namely, Such as have had any fellow≈øhip with God the Father, or with Chri≈øt: Such as do beleeve, or ≈øhall hereafter beleeve: And all tho≈øe poor tran≈øgre≈ø≈øors that come unto God the Father by Chri≈øt. Now ob≈øerve, how infinitely willing the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt is to intercede for us that are thus: That will appear thus:</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                  <hi>He mu≈øt needs be willing to do that which he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his anointing for.</hi> It is ≈øaid of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that he was anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and that ointment ran down upon his beard, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the skirts of all his garment: not a piece of <hi>Aarons</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but was perfumed with the ointment that <hi>Aaron</hi> was
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:162405:35"/>anointed with. Surely, there is not a skirt of the garment of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, but the anointment wherewithal He, our High-Prie≈øt was anointed, does run down upon him. He is the Me≈ø≈øiah, the anointment: So he is called in the 10. of <hi>I≈øaiah. The anointment. He was anointed with the oyle of gladne≈øs above all his fellows:</hi> above all the High-Prie≈øts that ever were before him. And he was anointed for this very end, That he might do the work of the High-Prie≈øt; which is, to Intercede for the ≈øins of the people. And therefore in that place in <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. <hi>If any man ≈øin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> Chri≈øt ≈øignifies A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed. If any man ≈øin, we have an Advocate with the Father: But who is that? He is <hi>Je≈øus,</hi> that ≈øignifies <hi>your Saviour,</hi> and ≈øo he is willing to intercede. I but, it may be he is not able to do it, it may be he hath not received the anointing to do it. Yes, He is called Chri≈øt. If any man ≈øin, we have an <hi>Advocate</hi> with the Father, Je≈øus Chri≈øt: or if you will, <hi>Saviour, Anointing.</hi> So that he is anointed for this end and purpo≈øe, to be your Advocate. Now if a man do receive money for to lay out for the benefit of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, poor Orphans, or the like: if a man be faithful, certainly, he will lay out the money for them, according to the intention of him that did tru≈øt him with the money. The Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, he hath received the Anointing, he is anointed as our great High-Prie≈øt, to do the work of the Prie≈øtly Office: and this is one work, to Intercede, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he mu≈øt needs be very willing to do it.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>The more any thing is the work of a mans Relation,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>wherewithal he is clothed, the more</hi> (if he be faithful) <hi>is he willing to do the work.</hi> And I pray mind it a little. When men are exalted, and come to Greatne≈ø≈øe, or Honor, then they give down the comforts of their Relation unto tho≈øe that depend upon them: If a father come to any great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; the comfort of the Relation of a father, then fals down upon the children, runs down then upon the fruit of his loynes. And ≈øo, if one friend do come unto prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the comfort of the Relation, (or friend≈øhip) fals
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:162405:36"/>down. Now the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, he is our High-Prie≈øt; and he is now exalted, he is gone to Heaven: and therefore all the comforts of all the Relations that he ≈øtands in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, do now fall upon us. And therefore, he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, he is very willing, becau≈øe this is the work of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>And further, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>It is the work of his Office.</hi> What a man does by office, that he does willingly; what a man does by office, he does indu≈øtriou≈øly, he does not do it by the bye: what a man does by office, he does it readily; according unto a mans place, or office, ≈øo will his interpretation be. Suppo≈øe now a Child that hath very good parts, come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore three men, of three ≈øeveral profe≈ø≈øions; A Lawyer, a Mini≈øter, and a Merchant. The Child having very good parts; the Merchant ≈øaies, He will make a very good Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant: the Lawyer ≈øaies, He will make a very good Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer: and the Mini≈øter ≈øaies, He wil make a very good Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: according to their three Relations, or Places, or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or work, their interpretation is. So now, if three men, of three ≈øeveral Trades, who≈øe work lies about wood, come and behold a fine green-tree: One man ≈øaies, It is good for this: And another ≈øaies, It is good for that: and the third ≈øaies, It is good for another u≈øe: according to his Place, and Calling, will his interpretation be. So now, when a poor ≈øoul comes before God: <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> (the Law) looks upon him: And the Devil looks upon him: And Je≈øus Chri≈øt looks upon him: The work of the Law, is to Condemn; The work of the Devil, to Accu≈øe; And the work of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, is to Intercede, it is the work of his office. Now therefore, a≈ø≈øoon as the Devil ≈øees ≈øuch a ≈øoul, Oh (≈øaies he) here's a fine in≈øtrument for me, here's a fit ≈øubject for me to injoy. A≈ø≈øoon as <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ≈øees this man, Here's a fine ≈øubject for me to condemne unto all Eternity. But when Je≈øus Chri≈øt looks upon ≈øuch a ≈øoul, ≈øaies he, Heres a fine ≈øoul for me to ≈øave unto all Eternity, to intercede for: why? becau≈øe it is his Office, and what a man does by office, he interprets accordingly. Therefore what the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:162405:36"/>Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt does, he does by office, and he does it readily, and willingly. And I will give you one demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtration of it; It was the end why Je≈øus Chri≈øt was taken into Heaven, into the Holy of Holie≈øt; that he might In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede. According to the Scriptures mentioned before, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. <hi>For Chri≈øt is not entered into holy places made with hands, but into Heaven it ≈øelf, now to appear in the pre≈øence of God for us.</hi> He does not ≈øay thus, Chri≈øt is now gone to Heaven, to be glorified there; Chri≈øt is now gone to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to injoy the bo≈øome of his Father, for his own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs. No, but he is gone into Heaven to appear in the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of God for us.</hi> This is the end of his a≈øcention. And ≈øo again in the 7. of the <hi>Hebrews, Wherefore, he is able to ≈øave to the uttermo≈øt, ≈øeeing he ever liveth to make interce≈ø≈øion for us.</hi> What? is he in Heaven to be glorified there? No, but the end why Chri≈øt is in Heaven, <hi>Is to make interce≈ø≈øion for poor ≈øinners:</hi> And therefore, he mu≈øt needs be infinitly willing to do this, becau≈øe it is the end of his going thither, into the Holy of Holie≈øt. Oh therefore, be of good comfort, all you that do come unto God by him, for he is willing to intercede for you. And let not any thing di≈øcourage you: It may be you will complain, and ≈øay Oh! but I am much oppo≈øed here in this world. What matter, ≈øo long as Je≈øus Chri≈øt does intercede for me in Heaven, and ≈øpeaks good words unto God the Father for me in heaven; what though I be oppo≈øed by men? It may be you will complain, and ≈øay, Oh! but I am much tempted, and cannot pray. Be humbled for it; but yet know this, That when you cannot pray, Chri≈øt prayes for you; and he prayes that you may pray. It may be you complain, and ≈øay, Oh! but I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under ≈øuch and ≈øuch corruptions, and the Devil he is bu≈øie with me, exceeding bu≈øie, and I cannot overcome them: and the Devil ≈øtands at my right hand for to tempt me, and to lead me into ≈øuch and ≈øuch ≈øins. Wel, be it ≈øo, yet notwith≈øtanding, the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, he is at the right hand of our Father, and he is ≈øet down at the right hand of God the Father, till all enemies be made his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtool;

Shall the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, as the great High-Prie≈øt, take my name, and carry it upon his brea≈øt into the pre≈øence of God the Father? and ≈øhall not I take the Name of Chri≈øt, and hold it forth to the world?

Me thinks we have here before us, the greate≈øt argument in the world for to make us to walke clo≈øely with God in Chri≈øt: For, ≈øhall the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, ≈øpend of his Eternity for me? and ≈øhall not I ≈øpend of my whole time for him? He Ever liveth: he Ever liveth to make interce≈ø≈øion. Before the world was made, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light was in the habitable parts of the earth, among the children of men. He laid out him≈øelf in delighting upon you before the world was made. Well, in due time, he comes down into the world; and here while he was upon the earth, he laid out him≈øelf fully for you. Then he Dies, and goes up to Heaven, and (≈øaies he) <hi>I go to prepare a place for you.</hi> He was at work for you, before the world began; Then he comes down upon the earth, and here he ≈øpends all his time for you: And now that he is gone to Heaven; the text ≈øaith, <hi>He ever liveth to make interce≈ø≈øion for you:</hi> he ≈øpends off all his eternity for you. Oh! does not the Lord Je≈øus grutch me Eternity, to ≈øpend off his Eternity for my ≈øoul? and ≈øhall I grutch the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt a little time, to ≈øpend a little time for him? Surely, people don't think what Chri≈øt is doing in Heaven for them, (you that are Saints e≈øpecially) if you did, you could not be padling in the world ≈øo much. Shall the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in Heaven for me? and ≈øhall I be digging in the world? Shall he be making mention of my name unto God the Father, and interceding for me? and ≈øhall I be ≈øinning again≈øt him? ≈øhall I be contending with his children? ≈øhall I now be joyning with his Enemies? ≈øhall I be oppo≈øing his waies? Oh! if people would but think, what the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt is doing in heaven for them, they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel ≈øo in the world again≈øt him as they do. Wherefore, that you may be kept from your ≈øins, &amp; kept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the world, think of the≈øe things.

               <p>Now if we inquire further, we ≈øhall find al≈øo, That the work of the High-Prie≈øt was, and now is, <hi>To offer up the gifts of the people unto God: To pre≈øent our, Prayers, Prai≈øes, Duties, Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and all ≈øpiritual Performances unto God the Father, and to procure acceptance of him.</hi> This was done thus: In the times of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> in the Tabernacle there were two Parts, or Courts; (as we reade in the 9. Chapter of the <hi>Hebrews</hi>) In the one, which was called, The Holy of Holie≈øt; there was the Arke, the Mercy-Seat, the Cherubims of glory, and the golden Cen≈øer. In the other, there was the Bra≈øen-Altar, upon which they offered ≈øacrifices, there was the table of Shewbread, the golden Candle≈øtick, and the golden Altar, upon which incen≈øe was: This is expre≈øly laid down in the 2, 3, and 4. ver≈øes of that 9. of <hi>Hebrews: For there was a taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:162405:39"/>made, the fir≈øt wherein was the candle≈øtick and the table and the ≈øhew-bread; which is called the ≈øanctuary. And after the Second vail, the tabernacle which is called the holie≈øt of all, which had the golden cen≈øer, and the ark of the covenant, overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and</hi> Aarons <hi>rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it the cherubims of glory ≈øhadowing the Mercy-Seat.</hi> And as every day, morning and evening, there was a lamb offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, a ≈øacrifice for the ≈øins of the people, upon the Bra≈øen-Alter; So every day, morning and evening, there was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen≈øe al≈øo, upon the golden-Altar: which was performed while the people were without at prayer, mingling that incen≈øe with their prayers; As it is in the 1.

All which was a great Type of Je≈øus Chri≈øt our High-Prie≈øt: who though he offered up him≈øelf a ≈øacrifice once for ≈øin without, yet when he died, and a≈øcended, he carried the vertue of that his blood into the Holy of Holie≈øt, into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ≈øprinkled the Mercy-Seat therewith: Although he began to make Interce≈ø≈øion while he lived, as we reade in the 17. of <hi>John;</hi> yet when he a≈øcended up into Heaven, the Holy of Holie≈øt, then he did take his golden Cen≈øer,

And this he does now as our High-Prie≈øt; for if we look into this book of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> we ≈øhall find, That the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaking of the High Prie≈øt, relating unto Je≈øus Chri≈øt; ≈øaies, in the 5. Chapter and the 1. ver≈øe, That it was his work to offer Gifts: <hi>That he may offer both Gifts and ≈øacrifices.</hi> And ≈øo in the 8. Chapter and the 3. ver≈ø. <hi>Every High-Pri≈øt is ordained to offer Gifts and Sacrifices.</hi> Thus we have another great work, of our great High-Prie≈øt; which is, To offer up all our Prayers, our Duties, our Gifts unto God the Father: which if ye will, we may call another part of Chri≈øts Interce≈ø≈øion; but I handle it di≈øtinct.</p>

                  <hi>He doth take our per≈øons, and carries them in unto God the Father, in a mo≈øt unperceivable way to us.</hi> He knows, that if our Per≈øon be not fir≈øt accepted, our Duty cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. Love me, and love my Duty; love me, &amp; love my Service: hate me, and hate my Service. In the Covenant
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:162405:41"/>of Works, God did fir≈øt accept of the work, and then of the Per≈øon, the Per≈øon for the work: But in the Covenant of Grace, God doth fir≈øt accept of the Per≈øon, and then the Work.

This was plainly ≈øhadowed out unto us, by that of the High-Pre≈øt; Who went into the Holy of Holie≈øt, with the Names of all the Tribes upon his brea≈øt. Which the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> ≈øpeaks out plainly:<note place="margin">

As a child, having run away from his Father, is taken by the hand of a friend, or of his Elder brother, and brought again into the pre≈øence of his father: So, all we having run away from God, are taken, and led again into the pre≈øence of the Father by the hand of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. He is that lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Jacob</hi> ≈øaw, upon whom we do a≈øcend into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome of God, and go into Heaven. Our High-Prie≈øt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt, doth fir≈øt take our Per≈øons, and lead us into the pre≈øence of God the Father. That is the fir≈øt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>As he doth take our Per≈øons, and lead,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>and carry us into the pre≈øence of God the Father: So, when we do perform any Duty, he doth ob≈øerve what evil, or failing there is in that Duty, and draws it out, takes it away before he pre≈øents the Duty-unto God the Father.</hi> A Child that would pre≈øent his father with a No≈øe-gay, or Po≈øie, goes into the garden, and he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers flowers, and weeds together; but coming to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ≈øhe takes them, and picks out the weeds, and binds up the flowers by them≈øelves, and ≈øo it is pre≈øented to the father, Thus it is with us: We go to Duty, and we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weeds, &amp; flowers together: But the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, he comes and picks out the weeds, and then he pre≈øents no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but flowers unto God the Father.</p>
               <p>And this we have plainly ≈øet forth unto us, by that of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:162405:42"/>the High-Prie≈øt taking away the iniquities of the Holy things of Gods people, in the 28. Chapter of <hi>Exodus, Thou ≈øhalt make a plat-form of pure gold</hi> (at the 36. ver≈øe) <hi>and grave upon it like the ingravings of a ≈øignet,</hi> HOLINES UNTO THE LORD. <hi>And thou ≈øhalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the Mytre; upon the forefront of the Mytre it ≈øhall be.</hi> Then at the 38. ver≈øe, <hi>And it ≈øhall be on</hi> Aarons <hi>forehead</hi> (that is, the High-Prie≈øt) <hi>that</hi> Aaron <hi>may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the Children of I≈ørael ≈øhall hallow in all their holy guifts: and it ≈øhall be alwaies upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the Lord.</hi> Thus taking away the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of their holy things. So it is ≈øaid concerning our Saviour Chri≈øt, in the 3. Chapter of <hi>Malachy,</hi> the 2, 3, &amp; 4. ver≈øes, <hi>Who may abide the day of his coming?</hi> (plainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood of Chri≈øt, as appears by the fir≈øt ver≈ø.) Then at the 3. <hi>He ≈øhall ≈øit as a refiner, and purifier of ≈øilver; and he ≈øhall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the Sons of</hi> Levi, <hi>and purge them as gold and ≈øelver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteou≈øne≈øs. Then ≈øhall the offerings of Judah and Jeru≈øalem be plea≈øant unto the Lord, as in the dayes of old.</hi> Then ≈øhall their offerings be plea≈øant; When? when he hath purg'd their ≈øacrifices, and their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. This in the daies of his fle≈øh and now much more. This is the Second thing, that the Lord Chri≈øt, our great High-Prie≈øt doth in offering up our Gifts unto God the Father, He takes out the weeds.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>As he takes away the iniquity of our holy things; So he ob≈øerves what good there is in any of our Duties, or Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances; and with that he mingles his own Prayers and Interce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions; his own Inten≈øe; and pre≈øents all as one work mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unto God the Father.</hi> This we have ≈øo fully in the 8. Chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that I need name no other place. <hi>Another Angel</hi> (at the 3. ver≈øe) <hi>≈øtood at the Altar, having a golden Cen≈øer, and there was given unto him much incen≈øe, that he ≈øhould offer it with the prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar, which was before the Throne. And the ≈ømoke</hi> (at the 4. ver≈øe) <hi>of the incen≈øe which came with the prayers of the Saints, a≈øcended up before God, out of the Angels hand:</hi> This mu≈øt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:162405:42"/>needs be under≈øtood of Chri≈øt; for no Angel does inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede but Chri≈øt, who is called, <hi>The Angel of the Covenant.</hi> 'Tis ≈øaid here, He ≈øtood at the Altar, having a golden Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øer: Which none of the High-Prie≈øts had: and there was given unto him much incen≈øe, and this he offered with the prayers of all the Saints; and the ≈ømoake of the incen≈øe came with the prayers of the Saints, and a≈øcended up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord. He alludes unto the way, and cu≈øtome of the Jewes, and the High-Prie≈øt: ≈øhewing, that the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt doth all this for us, as our great High-Prie≈øt: that is the meaning of it. So that this is plain what he doth, when as our great High-Prie≈øt, he offers up our Gifts unto God the Father.</p>
               <p>But in the Second place: <hi>Suppo≈øe he doth ≈øo, What Favour,</hi>

                  <hi>Father</hi> (≈øaies he) <hi>I thank thee that thou heare≈øt me alwaies.</hi> He never ≈øpake a word unto God the Father, but the father heard him alwaies. We reade (as I remember) but of Two places in the new Te≈øtament, where the Lord by an audible voice, gives te≈øtimony of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt his Son: And in both tho≈øe places, we have the ≈øame words uttered, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea≈øed:</hi> And again; <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea≈øed.</hi> We may know what favour a man hath with another, by the Tru≈øt that he doth commit to, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe upon him: <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> had great favour in the eyes of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> and how did it appear? It appear'd by this, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe <hi>Pharaoh</hi> tru≈øted him with ≈øo much. Now God the Father, hath tru≈øted Je≈øus Chri≈øt, this our great High-Prie≈øt, very much. This I ≈øhall evidence in Four Particulars, viz. <hi>What a great Tru≈øt God the Father hath put upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> It was an agreement between God the Father, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and Chri≈øt, the Second Per≈øon; before the world was, That in due time, he ≈øhould come into the world, take fle≈øh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and die for ≈øinners: and he did ≈øo. But before Chri≈øt came into the world, there were thou≈øands of ≈øouls ≈øaved; How came they to be ≈øaved? They came to be ≈øaved
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:162405:43"/>by the blood of Chri≈øt, and before Chri≈øt had died. So then, God the Father ≈øaved them upon Chri≈øts bare word, That he would come into the world, and die for them. What a mighty Tru≈øt was here? That ≈øo many hundred thou≈øand ≈øouls ≈øhould be ≈øaved, upon a bare word of Chri≈øt That he would come into the world, and die for them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>
               <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The Tru≈øt appears in this: That he was made when he did come into the world, the great Lord-Trea≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of all the Grace, and Comfort, that ≈øhould be given out unto the children of men. When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> tru≈øted <hi>Jo≈øeph,</hi> all the whole kingdom was put into his hand, with the Corn thereof, and not a grain was to be given out to any but as <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> gave it out: which argued a mighty Tru≈øt. So now, That not any Grace, or Comfort, given out to the children of men, but only by the hand of Chri≈øt, it argues a mighty Tru≈øt that the Father put upon him.</p>

This indeed is the wonder of all, that he ≈øhould deal thus by us: For, did we ever hear of any garment, that would make the crooked ≈øtraight?

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:162405:47"/>acceptance, and according to the≈øe we ≈øhall be judged. Surely then, if he takes our Duties and carries them in for acceptance, unto God the Father, he will never judge you for them, and condemn you for them at that day. Here is Comfort!</p>
               <p>Once more, Is it not a Comfort, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> for a poor begger to be relieved at a rich-mans door? We are al beggers in regard of Heaven; and the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, he does not only come forth and ≈øerve us, but he takes us (poor beggers) by the hand, and leads us in to his Father. Oh! what Comfort is here! what Comfort is here!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Indeed if I were able to ≈øay, That the Lord did accept my Duty,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cbj.</note> 
                  <hi>this were Comfort indeed; if I were able to conclude, That the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt did take my Prayers, and my Duties, and carry them in unto God the Father; this were ≈øweet con≈øolation: but how ≈øhall I know that?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt be our High-Prie≈øt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈ø. </seg>
                  </label> then we may ≈øay al≈øo, that he takes our duties, and carries them in for acceptance unto God the Father: if we may ≈øay that Je≈øus Chri≈øt hath ≈øatisfied for us, and doth intercede for us, then we may ≈øay al≈øo, that he takes our duties, and carries them for acceptance unto God the Father.</p>
               <p>But yet a little further, to bring this Comfort nearer to your hearts; give me leave to appeal to you:</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt. Who≈øoever thou art that makes this Objection: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Did≈øt thou never find a ≈øpiritual fire come down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (as it were) upon thy heart in Duty, or after Duty? In the times of the old-Te≈øtament, if they offered up a ≈øacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and a material fire came down from Heaven and burnt up the ≈øacrifice to a≈øhes, it was a certain te≈øtimony, that the ≈øacrifice was accepted. Now in the times of the Go≈øpel we mu≈øt not expect material fire to come down upon our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: But hath the Lord at any time cau≈øed an inward, and ≈øpiritual fire to fall down upon thy heart, warming thy ≈øpirit in Dutie? there the Lord ≈øpeaks thus much to thee; Thy ≈øacrifice is turn'd into a≈øhes, and it is accepted by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:162405:48"/>
               <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Did you never find in your heart (you that make this Objection) to Pray, and Cry, and Intercede for others, for the godly e≈øpecially? Look what di≈øpo≈øition there is in your heart towards the members of Chri≈øt, there is the ≈øame di≈øpo≈øition in Chri≈øt's heart towards you. Ah! do you think that there is love in your bo≈øome towards the Saints; and that there is none in Chri≈øt's heart towards you? Do you think that your bowels are more large than Chri≈øt's? Can≈øt thou find in thine heart to go unto God, when thou ≈øee≈øt a Saint in mi≈øery, to go to God, and pray, and cry, and intercede for him? and don't you think that the Lord Je≈øus hath as much bowels towards you, to go and intercede for you, and pre≈øent your prayers unto God the Father.</p>
               <p>Further, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Don't you look upon your own Duties, as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from your ≈øelves, mo≈øt unworthy? Beloved! 'tis in regard of Duties, as it is in regard of Per≈øons: When a man does judge him≈øelf to be mo≈øt unworthy, then Chri≈øt counts him worthy, God counts him worthy in Chri≈øt. As you reade in the 1. of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> ≈øaies the Spou≈øe there, ver. 5. <hi>I am black (O ye daughters of Jeru≈øalem) as the tents of Kedar: Look not upon me becau≈øe I am black, ver.</hi> 6. Now would you ≈øee Chri≈øts opinion of her, that counts her ≈øelf black? ≈øaith ≈øhe, <hi>Black,</hi> and <hi>Black again:</hi> but Chri≈øt ≈øaith concerning her; ver≈øe, 8. <hi>O thou faire≈øt among women.</hi> She calls her ≈øelf <hi>Black,</hi> and Chri≈øt cals her <hi>Fair,</hi> and <hi>the Faire≈øt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong women.</hi> Now, when a man doth count him≈øelf mo≈øt unworthy, God counts him mo≈øt worthy: and when a man looks upon his own Duties, and Sacrifices, as mo≈øt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, they are look't upon by Je≈øus Chri≈øt as mo≈øt worthy, poor prayers in our eyes, are precious in Gods eye.</p>
               <p>A word more, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Don't ye think, that grace is larger now, in the times of the Go≈øpel, than it was in the times of the Law? If ye doubt it, as unto this particular; Look upon the 30. Chapter of <hi>Exodus;</hi> compared with the 41. of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel.</hi> In the 30. Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> The Lord commands an Altar to be made to burn incen≈øe upon; <hi>Of Shittim wood
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:162405:48"/>≈øhalt thou make it;</hi> ver≈øe the 1. <hi>A cubit ≈øhall be the length there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> ver≈øe the 2. The Altar is for Incen≈øe; 'tis the matter that now we are upon: <hi>A cubit ≈øhall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and two cubits ≈øhall be the highth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> Now in the 41. Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> he ≈øpeaks of the Altar in the times of the Go≈øpel: and (≈øaith he) at the 22. ver≈øe, ('tis the Altar of incen≈øe that there is pre≈øcribed to be made, the Altar of wood, of Shettem wood.) <hi>The Altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits.</hi> And yet again, this altar of incen≈øe in the times of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel, is to be as large again, as that in the times of the Law; as high, and as long, and as large again. In the times of the Law, times of the old-Te≈øtament; a poor ≈øoul might go unto the High-Prie≈øt, and might challenge a right in him, and might ≈øay, That his Service, and his Duty, and his Sacrifice was accepted by the High-Prie≈øt. If in the times of the Old-Te≈øtament a man might ≈øay ≈øo; much more may a poor ≈øoul now go unto Je≈øus Chri≈øt, our great High-Prie≈øt, and ≈øay, That his Service, and his Duty, and Sacrifice, is accepted through him. Here is abundance of Comfort unto the Saints: be of good comfort, all you that do beleeve.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>How doth this make unto our Holine≈øs,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>Much every way: <label type="milestone">

                  </label> 
               </p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, In ca≈øe I be Ungodly, a Wicked man: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Here is that that may for ever keep me, from oppo≈øition to the good wayes of God. I have ≈øaid ≈øometimes (may a wicked man ≈øay) concerning godly mens duties, That it was their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocri≈øie: And I have ≈øaid concerning ≈øuch and ≈øuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øors, This is your Pride, and this is your Singularity; and I have oppo≈øed with all bitterne≈øs, and earne≈øtne≈øs, the prayings, and wre≈øtlings of ≈øome of Gods people? But is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:162405:49"/>this true, That the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, takes every Prayer, of the meane≈øt of Gods Children, and carries it into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øom of God the Father? and ≈øhall I ≈øpit upon that that Chri≈øt owns? ≈øhall I dare to oppo≈øe that that the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt pre≈øents unto his Father? The Lord in mercy pardon me: I have ≈øinned and done fooli≈øhly, and for ought I know, I may have ≈øpoken evill of that Duty, that Chri≈øt hath carried into the pre≈øence of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Oh! through the Lords grace then, for ever will I leave to make any oppo≈øition, again≈øt any of the good waies of God again, and I will never ≈øpeake one word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the per≈øons, meetings, or ≈øupplications of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly again.</p>
               <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In ca≈øe a man be Ungodly, a wicked man: Here is mighty incouragement, for to come unto Je≈øus Chri≈øt; I, and to come pre≈øently. For, is Je≈øus Chri≈øt the ladder that <hi>Jacob</hi> ≈øaw, by whom we go up to Heaven? doth he take all our Duties, and Prayers, and pre≈øent them to God the Father for acceptance? Then, till I do come to Chri≈øt, all is nothing, all is lo≈øt: if I be a Drunkard, and will not come to Chri≈øt, Prayer is all lo≈øt; if I be a Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and will not come to Chri≈øt, an Unclean wretch, and will not come to Chri≈øt; all my Prayers, and all my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are lo≈øt: Oh! the Lord pity me, (may many a poor ≈øoul ≈øay) I have lo≈øt too many Prayers already; through the Lords grace, now I will lo≈øe no more: Oh! I come to Chri≈øt, Lord, I come, I come. This is a mighty incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, to make every man now for to come unto Je≈øus Chri≈øt: becau≈øe the Lord Je≈øus, our High-Prie≈øt, takes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Duty; and carries it into the bo≈øom. of God the Father for acceptance. Thus for Ungodly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In ca≈øe a man be Godly; this truth doth conduce to our further Holine≈øs, and growth in grace.</p>
               <p>If I be Codly: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Then here I ≈øee infinite rea≈øon, why I ≈øhould be much in Duty; not only pray, but be much in prayer. Why? for the Lord Chri≈øt taketh all, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries all into the bo≈øom of the Father, mingles his own o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:162405:49"/>interce≈ø≈øions with it, although it be but a ≈øigh, and a groane. The Apo≈øtle upon this account, makes this u≈øe of it; having ≈øpoken of Chri≈øt our High-Prie≈øt; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (≈øaith he) <hi>let us come with boldne≈øs vnto the Throne of grace.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16</note> The word ≈øignifies, to ≈øpeak all ones mind; let us come <hi>≈øpeaking all.</hi> Having ≈øuch an High-Prie≈øt indeed, as will carry all into the pre≈øence of God the Father, for accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, every ≈øigh, and every groan; then, who would not be much in prayer? ≈øpeak all to Chri≈øt, be free with Chri≈øt, <hi>come with boldne≈øs?</hi> There's many a poor ≈øoul, that is much di≈øcouraged, and he dares not go to prayer, many times, afraid to go to the Throne of grace. The rea≈øon is, becau≈øe he looks upon his Prayer, or Duty, as it lies upon his own heart, or as it comes from him≈øelf. Whereas, my beloved, 'tis with your Prayers, and Duties, as it is with fire: Your kitchin fire is troubled with abundance of ≈ømoake, and there is filth about it; fire upon the hearth hath much ≈ømoake: but fire above, in the Element of fire, there's no ≈ømoke. So, your Prayer, when it lies upon your own hearth (as I may ≈øay) there's a great deal of ≈ømoke; but when it gets once into the hands of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, there's it's Element, and it is freed from all it's ≈ømoke. Or as it is with a mans Body: ≈øo long as he lives here upon the earth, he is feeble, and weak, and many times ≈øickly: a≈ø≈øoon as he is come into Heaven, all his weakne≈øs is taken away, and his body being in Heaven, 'tis pre≈øently glorified, and ≈øtrength put upon it, and all his di≈øea≈øes are gone. So 'tis with our Prayers: So long as they are here below, in our own bo≈øoms, they are full of weakne≈øs; but a≈ø≈øoon as our Prayer is out of our mouth, 'tis in the hand of Chri≈øt, 'tis in Heaven, 'tis glorified, the weakne≈øs is now done away; Oh! 'tis a glorified Prayer; when once 'tis gone from you, 'tis in the hand of Chri≈øt. And therefore, this is a mighty incouragement unto all tho≈øe that are godly, to be, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Prayer, but to be much in Prayer, come with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs unto the Throne of grace.</p>
               <p>Again, If ye be Godly; yea, if ye be Ungodly: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Here I
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:162405:50"/>≈øee infinite rea≈øon, why I ≈øhould receive every Truth that comes from Chri≈øt, though accompanied with many fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in him that ≈øpeaks it. The Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of every prayer, and duty that comes from me; though it have many weakne≈ø≈øes: yea, he takes my Prayer, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it into the pre≈øence of God the Father for acceptance, my poor Prayer, labouring with many weakne≈ø≈øes: Then when a Truth comes from Chri≈øt, ≈øhall not I accept of it? what though the Mini≈øter, or Preacher that ≈øpeaks it, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with this or that weakne≈øs? There is Pride, or there is ≈øome mi≈øcarriage in the delivery, or the like: Shall the Lord Chri≈øt take my Prayer, labouring under infirmity, and accept thereof, and carry it into the pre≈øence of God the Father for acceptance, notwith≈øtanding all the failings of my Duty? and ≈øhall not I accept of Truth that comes from Chri≈øt, notwith≈øtanding all the failings of the poor me≈ø≈øenger that brings it?</p>
               <p>Further, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>The more Evangelical you are in your Obedience, the more Holy ye are in your lives.</hi> This truth that is now before ye, well ≈øtudied and con≈øidered, will make you more Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in an Evangelical way. And ye ≈øhall find therefore, that the Lord him≈øelf from Heaven does make this u≈øe of it: pray con≈øult with the 17. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the 5. ver≈øe. <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well plea≈øed: hear ye him.</hi> Tho≈øe words follow, <hi>Hear him.</hi> Hearing notes Faith, and Obedience; not a bare Hearing with the ear.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:162405:50"/>And now here, in this 17. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> at the transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> appeared, which they did not in the 3. of <hi>Matthew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Con≈øider, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that the Empha≈øis may lie upon the word <hi>Hear,</hi> and not upon the word <hi>Him,</hi> only: <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well plea≈øed: Hear ye him;</hi> His face did ≈øhine as the Sun, and his rayment was white as the light.

               <p>But again, Here now in the 17. Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi>

Mo≈øes</hi> that gave the Law; <hi>Elias</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtored it. <hi>Then an≈øwered</hi> Peter <hi>and ≈øaid unto Je≈øus; Lord, 'tis good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here Three Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles; one for Thee, and one for</hi> Mo≈øes <hi>and one for</hi> Elias. <hi>Peter</hi> and ≈øo the re≈øt of the Di≈øciples, began for to equallize <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes</hi> to Je≈øus Chri≈øt: One for <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> and one for <hi>Elias,</hi> and one for Je≈øus Chri≈øt; no more for Chri≈øt than for <hi>Mo≈øes.</hi> Now the Lord takes <hi>Peter</hi> off from all his mi≈øtakings: Your eye is upon <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> (≈øaith he) but I (≈øaith the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty) am wel plea≈øed in my Son: This is my beloved Son in whom I am well plea≈øed.

               <p>Again further, <hi>The more glory Chri≈øt does appear in,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>the greater rea≈øon there is why we ≈øhould hear him.</hi> Now here the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt appeared in glory; his face did ≈øhine as the Sun, and his raiment was white as the light. In the 3.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:162405:51"/>of <hi>Matthew,</hi> he was there baptized, and he did not appear in glory: but now here he appears in glory; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øaies the Lord, now <hi>Hear him;</hi> this is your glorious Saviour, Hear him.

               <p>Yet further, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                  <hi>The more a man can rejoyce in ≈øpiritual priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with humility: and the more humble a man is, and yet can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in his ≈øpiritual priviledges, the more holy he is:</hi> there goes a great deal of Holine≈øs to it, to joyn the≈øe two together: for a man to rejoyce in his ≈øpiritual priviledges and yet to be humble: and to walk very humbly. Some there are, that look upon ther ≈øpiritual priviledges, and rejoyce much; but they don't walk humbly: Some labour to walk humbly, and are much troubled in the con≈øiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their own evil; but they don't rejoyce in their ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual priviledges. Give me a Chri≈øtian that doth both, and he is a ble≈ø≈øed man. The ≈øtudy of this Truth that is now before you, will teach you to do both, to do both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether For, what a great priviledge is this, not a figh, not a groane, not a duty, but the Lord Chri≈øt takes it, and carries it in, and pre≈øents it to God the Father for me, whereby I have acceptance? Con≈øidering this; here is matter of much joy and rejoycing. I but, It is Chri≈øt that does it; there is no ≈øuch worthine≈øs in mine own duty; it were lo≈øt, and ca≈øt away, if Je≈øus Chri≈øt did not take it in his hand, and carry it into the bo≈øome of God the Father; and therefore, why ≈øhould I not walk humbly.</p>
               <p>I conclude all with this, If that the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, our great High-Prie≈øt, offers up all our Gifts unto God the Father, whereby we have acceptance: What infinite
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:162405:51"/>cau≈øe have we all to be Thankful to God for Chri≈øt, and to love Je≈øus Chri≈øt for ever!</p>
               <p>Suppo≈øe one of you had been among the Di≈øciples, when the Lord Chri≈øt wa≈øh't his Di≈øciples feet; and he ≈øhould have come, and wa≈øh't your feet, and have done it; would not your heart have glowed with love to Je≈øus Chri≈øt? Yet when the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt wa≈øh't his Di≈øciples feet, it was in the daies of his fle≈øh, when he was here on the earth: but now he is in glory, and yet for all this, he takes your dirty prayers, and does (as it were) wa≈øh the feet of your prayers, that he may pre≈øent them to God the Father: he wa≈øhes your tears over again in his bloud, and pre≈øents them to God the Father: he takes all your Duties, and perfumes them with his interce≈ø≈øions, and ≈øo pre≈øents them unto God the Father. Oh! what cau≈øe have we to love Je≈øus Chri≈øt! Oh! you, that never loved Chri≈øt, love him now; and you that have loved him before, love him much more: you that fear the lord, love the Lord: and let us all, even go away with our hearts warmed with this love, ble≈ø≈øing, and prai≈øing the Name of the Lord.</p>
               <p>And thus I have led you into a Third work of our great Hight Prie≈øt, which is this, <hi>To offer up the Gifts of the people unto God the Father:</hi> A Fourth follows, &amp;c.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath been opened and applied, that the work of the High-Prie≈øt, was, and is, To ≈øatisfie for the ≈øins of the people; to make Interce≈ø≈øion for them; and to offer up their Gifts unto God the Father; all which Chri≈øt doth for us.</p>
               <p>I ≈øhall ≈øpeak of one work more of our great High-Prie≈øt, and that is, <hi>To ble≈øs the people.</hi> We reade in the Old-Te≈øtament, of two ≈øorts of High-Prie≈øts: One according to the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the Levitical High-Prie≈øt, (as I may ≈øo ≈øpeak) and his work was, for to Ble≈øs the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; as we may reade in the 6.

                  <hi>and of Chri≈øt, con≈øi≈øteth in Spiritual things e≈øpecially, and not in Temporal.</hi> And therefore ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, in that 1. of the <hi>Ephe≈øians,</hi> and the 3. ver≈øe: <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed be the God and Father of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who hath ble≈ø≈øed us, with all Spiritual ble≈ø≈øings, in Heavenly places in Chri≈øt.</hi> The Cur≈øe, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, that do befal men now under the Go≈øpel, are not in outward afflictions, and bodily troubles ≈øo much; as in Spiritual mi≈øeries, Blindne≈øs of mind, and Hardne≈øs of heart: And ≈øo al≈øo on the contrary, the ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing of the Go≈øpel, doth not con≈øi≈øt much in Outward things, as in Spiritual, <hi>Who hath ble≈ø≈øed us with Spiritual ble≈ø≈øings.</hi> Indeed, if we look into the old Te≈øtament we
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:162405:53"/>≈øhall find, That when <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> did ble≈øs the people, he ble≈øt them much in Temporal ble≈ø≈øings. in the 28. of <hi>Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and the 2. ver≈øe. <hi>All the≈øe things ≈øhall come upon thee, and overtake thee, if thou ≈øhalt hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God.</hi> What ble≈ø≈øings are tho≈øe? <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed ≈øhalt thou be in the city, and ble≈ø≈øed ≈øhalt thou be in the field: ble≈ø≈øed ≈øhall be the fruit of thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattel, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe of thy kine, and the flocks of thy ≈øheep: ble≈ø≈øed ≈øhall be thy basket and thy ≈øtore.</hi> Thus he goes on in outward ble≈ø≈øings. But now, if we look into the Go≈øpel, and con≈øider the ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øings of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and lay them together with <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> we ≈øhall find them to be Spiritual ble≈ø≈øings. In the 5. of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> and the 3. ver≈øe, &amp;c. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are the poor in ≈øpirit, for their's is the Kingdom of Heaven: Ble≈ø≈øed are tho≈øe that mourn, for they ≈øall be comforted.</hi> Indeed the promi≈øe of the earth comes is at the 5. ver≈ø; but he returns again to Spiritual ble≈ø≈øings: <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are they which hunger and thir≈øt after right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs; for they ≈øhall be filled. Ble≈ø≈øed are the pure in heart; for they ≈øhall ≈øee God.</hi> Here are Spiritual ble≈ø≈øings; this is the ≈øtream of the Go≈øpel, it runs this way. When the Lord ble≈ø≈øeth a man, he gives him that which is ≈øutable to him. In the times of the Go≈øpel, men are more Spiritual than they were in the times of the Law; therefore Go≈øpel-ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øings, they are Spiritual ble≈ø≈øings. Every thing gives, and communicates to another, according to what it hath it ≈øelf: The Sun communicates light unto the world; becau≈øe it hath light it ≈øelf: And man communicates the nature of man unto his child, becau≈øe he hath the nature of man him≈øelf. So our Lord Chri≈øt, when he Ble≈ø≈øes, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates according unto what he hath him≈øelf; and his ble≈ø≈øings e≈øpecially con≈øi≈øting in ≈øpiritual things, ≈øo he doth ble≈ø≈øe. Indeed, as in the times of the Old Te≈øtament there were Spiritual ble≈ø≈øings, that were mixt with Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, by vertue of the Covenant that was made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> So now, Outward ble≈ø≈øings are thrown in as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verplus: but yet notwith≈øtanding, though they be not ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual in their nature, they are ≈øpiritual in their end; and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:162405:53"/>≈øo it is true to ≈øay, That the ble≈ø≈øing of the Go≈øpel, and of Chri≈øt is a ≈øpiritual ble≈ø≈øing.</p>
               <p>But more particularly, if yet ask me wherein this con≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? I ≈øhall name but Two things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fir≈øt, This Ble≈ø≈øing of the Go≈øpel, or of Chri≈øt,</hi>

                  <hi>it con≈øi≈øts in a ≈øupernatural, and ≈øpiritual injoyment of God in Chri≈øt, the love and favour of God in Chri≈øt.</hi> When the Prie≈øts ble≈øt in the time of the old Te≈øtament, in that 6. of <hi>Numbers,</hi> they ≈øaid, <hi>The Lord cau≈øe his face for to ≈øhine upon you. The Lord make his face for to ≈øhine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee: the Lord ble≈ø≈øe thee, and keepe thee. Ver≈øe,</hi> 24, 25, 26. Which the Spo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> expounding, in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> the 13. Chapter and the 14. ver≈øe, renders it thus: <hi>The grace of the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and the love of God, and the communion of the holy Gho≈øt, be with you all. Amen.</hi> The Lord ble≈ø≈øe thee, the Lord cau≈øe his face to ≈øhine upon you; the Lord lift up the light of his countenance upon you: Three times, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord; noting the <hi>Trinity;</hi> which the Apo≈øtle here explains by the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>holy Spirit.

                  <hi>for they ≈øhall ≈øee God.</hi> Seeing of God, is a ble≈ø≈øing out of the mouth of Chri≈øt, a Go≈øpel-ble≈ø≈øign. And what is it for a man to ≈øee God? In the phra≈øe of the old Te≈øtament, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, to <hi>See,</hi> it is ordinarily u≈øed for to <hi>Injoy.</hi> In the 4. <hi>P≈øalme. Who will ≈øhew us any good?</hi> The word in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew is, Who will make us to <hi>See any good?</hi> that is t <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy good.</hi> So then, to ≈øee God, it is to injoy him. When <hi>Jacob</hi> injoyed God, he ≈øaw him; and the place it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Peniel;</hi> for he had ≈øeen the Lord, and there the Lord ble≈øt him. There's no ≈øeeing of God but in Chri≈øt. And therefore I ≈øay, that herein confi≈øts the ble≈ø≈øing of the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, in a ≈øupernatural, and ≈øpiritual in joyment of God in Chri≈øt, the favour and love of God in Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>Again, It con≈øi≈øts al≈øo, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>in the Inhabitation of the holy Gho≈øt in our hearts: the giving out of the holy Gho≈øt unto the hearts of men.</hi> And therefore it is added in that place of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians; And the Communion of the holy Gho≈øt, be with you all.</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:162405:54"/>
                  <hi>Amen.</hi> That mu≈øt needs be the great ble≈ø≈øing of the Go≈øpel, and ≈øo of Chri≈øt; that is the thing promi≈øed in the Go≈øpel. What is that? If we look into the 1. Chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apo≈øtles, and the 4. ver≈øe, It is ≈øaid there of the Di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>That they ≈øhould wait for the promi≈øe of the Father.</hi> Chri≈øt commaded them that they ≈øhould not depart from Jeru≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, but wait for the promi≈øe of the Father. What is that? We know what it was, and is, that which befel afterward; it was the giving out of the holy Gho≈øt: the holy Gho≈øt fell upon them, &amp; this is called THE <hi>promi≈øe of the Father.</hi> That as in the times of the Old Te≈øtament, the promi≈øe was, the giving of the Son, and coming of the Second Per≈øon: So after Chri≈øt came, the great promi≈øe was, the coming of the Third Per≈øon, and the giving of the holy Gho≈øt. <hi>When I am gone</hi> (≈øaith Chri≈øt) <hi>I'le ≈øend ye another Comforter. He that beleeveth, out of his belly ≈øhall flow rivers of living water.</hi> This he ≈øpake concerning the Spirit, which was not yet given, in tho≈øe extraordinary emanations of gi≈øts and graces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he was not yet glori≈øied. So then, the great Ble≈ø≈øing that was to be given unto the children of men, the great Go≈øpel-ble≈ø≈øing, was the giving out of the holy Gho≈øt: this is a Go≈øpel-ble≈ø≈øing indeed.</p>

                  <hi>But what doth Chri≈øt do, when he doth Ble≈øs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's ob≈øervable, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>1</label> that when any Superiour did Ble≈ø≈øe; a father did ble≈ø≈øe his child, or the like, he did ob≈øerve what was the choice mercy, and good in tho≈øe times, and he did wi≈øh that unto his child, or unto his inferiour.

So now, when our Iord Je≈øus, our great High-Prie≈øt doth ble≈ø≈øe any man; ob≈øerving that the choice mercy of the Go≈øpel, is the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in Chri≈øt, the favour and love of God, and the giving out of the holy Gho≈øt into a mans heart; he doth wi≈ø all this good unto him, and he ≈øaies unto God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Lord, let this poor ≈øoul have thy favour; Oh! cau≈øe thy face to ≈øhine upon this poor ≈øoul, and give out the holy Gho≈øt unto it that it may walk after the ≈øpirit.</hi>

               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:162405:54"/>
               <p>In the Second place, It's ob≈øervable, That when the Prie≈øts did Ble≈ø≈øe the people, they did not barely wi≈øh good unto them, but they did Authoratatively pronounce them ble≈ø≈øed.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.27.</note> 
                  <hi>They ≈øhall put my name upon them (≈øaith the Lord) when they ble≈øs.</hi> So when the Lord Chri≈øt, our great High-Prie≈øt, doth Ble≈ø≈øe a man, he does not barely wi≈øh him good, The Lord cau≈øe his face for to ≈øhine upon that ≈øoul, in a way of wi≈øhing: but the Lord Chri≈øt being a High-Prie≈øt, when he ble≈ø≈øeth, he doth authoratatively pronounce ≈øuch a ≈øoul to be Ble≈ø≈øed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When the Prie≈øt Ble≈ø≈øed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> he did not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the people Ble≈ø≈øed: but in the Ble≈ø≈øing of the Prie≈øt, there was a kind of Binding-power; it had the power, force, and efficacy of an Ab≈øolution. And therefore as Chri≈øt ≈øaies unto his Di≈øciples, <hi>Go, and who≈øoever ≈øins ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, they ≈øhall be remitted:</hi> I'le ≈øtand by you in it. So ≈øaith the Lord in that ≈øame place, the 6. of <hi>Numbers. On this wi≈øe ≈øhall ye ble≈øs the children of I≈ørael, ≈øaying unto them, The Lord ble≈øse thee, and keep thee.</hi> and at the 27. ver≈øe, <hi>They ≈øhall put my Name upon the children of I≈ørael, and I will ble≈ø≈øethem.</hi> I'le ≈øtand by them in this. So when the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, our great High-Prie≈øt, doth Ble≈ø≈øe; he doth not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a man to be Ble≈ø≈øed, but he doth Ab≈øolve him from all his ≈øins; &amp; (≈øaith he) by authority that is given to me from my father, the Keyes that are put into my hand, I do Bind this ble≈ø≈øing upon this poor ≈øoul.</p>
               <p>Further, The Prie≈øt when he ble≈ø≈øed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> indeed he could wi≈øh well, and he could pronounce a man ble≈ø≈øed; and he might Ab≈øolve: but he could go no further, he could not confer the Ble≈ø≈øing, he could not be≈øtow the Ble≈ø≈øing: But our Lord Chri≈øt, being an High-Prie≈øt beyond all the High-Prie≈øts that ever were before him in this re≈øpect too; where he doth Ble≈ø≈øe, he be≈øtoweth the Ble≈ø≈øing, being God and man, he be≈øtoweth the Ble≈ø≈øing.</p>
               <p>In the Fifth place, This our great High-Prie≈øt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> being God and Man; look how God Ble≈ø≈øeth, ≈øo doth he Ble≈ø≈øe. In the Scripture, ye ≈øhall find, That when God the Father
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:162405:55"/>Ble≈ø≈øed, he ≈øaid unto tho≈øe things that he ble≈øt, <hi>Increa≈øe and Multiply:</hi> ≈øtill when he ble≈øt, <hi>Increa≈øe and Multiply.</hi> So the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt our High-Prei≈øt, when he comes to ble≈ø≈øe, he doth not barely wi≈øh good unto a poor ≈øoul, or pronounce him ble≈ø≈øed, or be≈ølow a good thing upon him; but ≈øaith he, <hi>O ≈øoul, Multiply in this good;</hi> the Lord increa≈øe thy Graces, and thy Gifts, and thy Comforts; poor ≈øoul, Increa≈øe and Multiply herein. This the Lord Chri≈øt our great High-Prie≈øt doth. Thus it's cleer what the Bl≈ø≈øing of the Go≈øpel is, wherein it con≈øi≈øts; and what our High-Prie≈øt doth, when he doth ble≈ø≈øe the people.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>Does this Ble≈ø≈øing properly, or ≈øpecially belong unto Je≈øus Chri≈øt?</hi>

               <p>Yes,<hi>An≈øw.</hi> For he was made a cur≈øe for ≈øin; he and none el≈øe made a cur≈øe for ≈øin: and therefore it belongs unto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the world for to ble≈ø≈øe.

Now he above all was cur≈øed, hung upon the Cro≈ø≈øe, and died a cur≈øed death, he was made a cur≈øe; therefore it belongs unto him above all for to give the ble≈ø≈øing, for to ble≈ø≈øe poor ≈øinners. <hi>Primum in quolibet genere &amp;c.</hi> The fir≈øt in every kind is the cau≈øe of the re≈øt.

There are Three that we reade of in Scripture e≈øpecially that did ble≈ø≈øe: The Father, the King, and the Prie≈øt: The Father did ble≈ø≈øe his Children; the King ble≈øt his Subjects, and the Prie≈øt ble≈øt the People. Now the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt He is our Father, <hi>The Everla≈øting Father;</hi> He is our King, <hi>I will ≈øet my King upon my holy hill;</hi> And he is our great High-Prie≈øt: and therefore, all the≈øe relations meeting in him, it belongs unto him above all for to ble≈ø≈øe the people.</p>

The Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt our High-Prie≈øt, does not Ble≈ø≈øe as man ble≈ø≈øes; and ≈øo his Ble≈ø≈øing is very much hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from our eyes; he does not ble≈ø≈øe as we do; he does not ble≈øs as the world does: if the world ≈øees a Rich man, it pronounces him ble≈ø≈øed: Oh! there's a ble≈ø≈øed man, and there's a happy man! what an excellent Dwelling hath he, how healthful! his Table is ≈øpread &amp;c. The world ble≈ø≈øes Rich men, pronounces them Happy and ble≈ø≈øed.

And ≈øo in regard of Ordinances. Two ≈øorts of Ordinances are brought before Chri≈øt; Gods Ordinance, and Mans Ordinance; and Mans Ordinance, in the eye of the world, is the Elder brother, and Gods Ordinance the Younger brother; and both the≈øe are brought before Chri≈øt for a ble≈ø≈øing, and the Ordinance of Man is ≈øet at the right hand of Chri≈øt by the world; but the Lord Chri≈øt, he cro≈ø≈øes hands, and he laies the ble≈ø≈øing upon the younger brother in this re≈øpect.

               <p>Fir≈øt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> When the Lord ble≈øt <hi>Abraham,</hi> he ≈øaid unto him, <hi>In thee, and thy ≈øeed ≈øhall all Nations be Ble≈øt.</hi> It's a ≈øign unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he was ble≈øt, becau≈øe others were ble≈ø≈øed by him. So now, when a mans Parts, Gifts, Graces, and Comforts are ble≈ø≈øings to others, it is an argument that that man is ble≈øt him≈øelf.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:162405:59"/>
               <p>Further, When a man is ble≈ø≈øed by God, or Chri≈øt; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he is drawn nearer to God by all outward things, by all things: <hi>Come ye Ble≈ø≈øed,</hi> Go ye Cur≈øed. Ble≈ø≈øing hath an attractive Nature, <hi>Come ye Ble≈ø≈øed:</hi> when the Lord Chri≈øt does ble≈øs a man, he does draw him, <hi>Come ye Ble≈ø≈øed.</hi> When a man is brought nearer to God by Affliction, he is ble≈ø≈øed: when a man is brought nearer to God by his E≈øtate, by any Comfort, by any Sorrow, here is ble≈ø≈øing, <hi>Come ye Ble≈ø≈øed.</hi> Ble≈ø≈øing draws one nearer to God with a cord of love.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Where the Lord does Ble≈øs, he does cau≈øe a man to Increa≈øe and Multiply, in that thing wherein he is Ble≈øt.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing and Multiplying, is ≈øo natural unto Ble≈ø≈øing, that in the Original tongues of the old and new Te≈øtament, <hi>Plenty</hi> is put for <hi>Ble≈ø≈øing.</hi> I will give you but one clear place for it in the new Te≈øtament, the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. Chapter, 5. ver≈øe. Therefore I thought it nece≈ø≈øary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto ye, and make up before hand your <hi>Bounty.</hi> The word is, your <hi>Ble≈ø≈øing.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you had notice before; that the ≈øame might be ready <hi>as a matter of Bounty.</hi> The word is, <hi>as a matter of Ble≈ø≈øing.</hi> But e≈øpecially in the next ver≈øe. But this I ≈øay, he which ≈øow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ≈øparingly, ≈øhal reap ≈øparingly: and he which ≈øoweth bountifully, ≈øhall reap bountifully. <hi>And he which ≈øoweth with Ble≈ø≈øing</hi> (as it is in the Original) <hi>≈øhall reap with Ble≈ø≈øing:</hi> And here 'tis oppo≈øed to Sparingly, and tran≈ølated Bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Where the Lord does ble≈ø≈øe, he does alwaies cau≈øe a man to Increa≈øe and Multiply.</p>
               <p>Now beloved in the Lord, I appeal unto all your ≈øouls, you that make this Objection, that are afraid the Lord Chri≈øt hath not ble≈øt you as your High-Prie≈øt, hath not laid his hand upon you, and ble≈øt you: yet don't ye know more of Chri≈øt than ye have known before? hath not the hidden truths of the Go≈øpel been increa≈øed and multiplied upon your hearts? hath not your hearts been brought nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to God by Affliction? hath not your ≈øouls been drawn neerer to God by his outward dealings with you? And as <hi>Abraham</hi> was therefore ble≈øt, becau≈øe he was made a ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:162405:60"/>to others: So I appeal to ye, have not your Parts, Gifts, and Graces, in ≈øome mea≈øure been ble≈ø≈øings unto others, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto your poor Family, and unto others al≈øo? Then be of good Comfort (man or woman) where ever thou ≈øtand'≈øt, the Lord Chri≈øt hath ble≈øt thee, and thou ≈øhalt be ble≈ø≈øed, hold up thy head poor ble≈ø≈øed ≈øoul, the Lord Je≈øus hath ble≈øt thee: when the Lord did lay this ble≈ø≈øing upon thee, I cannot till thee, but I find thee a ble≈ø≈øed man, ≈øtay thy ≈øelf upon the Lord, cheer up thy drooping heart, thou art a ble≈ø≈øed ≈øoul.</p>

                  </label> This holds forth great incouragement, unto all poor ≈øinners for to come to Chri≈øt, and to come without delay. Why? Once come to Chri≈øt and ble≈ø≈øed; but without Chri≈øt and Cur≈øed: an enemy to Je≈øus Chri≈øt and a Cur≈øed man: Cur≈øed in thy ≈øtore-hou≈øe: Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed in thy basket; and Cur≈øed in all things that thou putte≈øt thine hand unto. Oh! then, will you not come to Chri≈øt, that you may be Ble≈ø≈øed: That day that a poor ≈øoul comes unto Chri≈øt, whatever he hath been he is ble≈ø≈øed: that day may be called <hi>Gilgal,</hi> for then the Cur≈øe is rouled away from him. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed is the man who≈øe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is forgiven, and who≈øe ≈øin is pardoned.</hi> The fir≈øt day, the fir≈øt minute that he comes to Chri≈øt, his ≈øin is pardoned, and he is ble≈ø≈øed. Who would not then come unto Chri≈øt pre≈øently, that he may be ble≈øt for ever? When as <hi>E≈øan</hi> had ≈øold his Birth-right for a me≈øs of pottage, the Lord look't upon him as a Prophane man, and he ≈øtands upon record in Scripture for a Prophane man unto this day, becau≈øe he ≈øold his Birth-right. And ≈øaies the text, <hi>Though he ≈øought the Ble≈ø≈øing</hi> (it was a ble≈ø≈øing) <hi>with tears, he never recovered it.</hi> The Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, he is now among us, and offering to ble≈øs us; and if I will rather keep my ≈øins than come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Je≈øus Chri≈øt, the Lord will look upon me as a Prophane
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:162405:60"/>man; and I may go and ≈øeek the ble≈ø≈øing with tears, and never recover it again. Oh! here's that (me thinks) that ≈øhould make every wicked man; if there be ever a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, Swearer, or Unclean wanton that reades this book, mind what is ≈øaid for your Everla≈øting peace: I ≈øay, here's that (me thinks) that ≈øhould make every wicked man, to look upon the Godly, as <hi>David</hi> did upon the ≈øparrows, and upon the ≈øwallows: Saies <hi>David, The≈øe birds full nigh thine Altar may, have place to ≈øit and ≈øing:</hi> as ye have it in your ≈øinging P≈øalms. The≈øe birds can come and make their ne≈øts; but as for me, I am kept at a di≈øtance: He was provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the ≈øparrows, and ≈øwallows making their ne≈øts neer the Altar. So may a wicked man ≈øay, There's a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man indeed, he may go to Je≈øus Chri≈øt, he may go to Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, and he may offer up his Gift to God the Father by the hands of Chri≈øt, he can come neer to God by Chri≈øt: But as for me, I am yet without Chri≈øt, I am not yet gone to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt; I am ≈øuch a cur≈øed Swearer, I am ≈øuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Drunkard, I am ≈øuch a vile, wretched Wanton, ≈øuch a Notorious, Scandelous ≈øinner: Oh! the≈øe people are ble≈ø≈øed, but I am Cur≈øed, but now through the Lords grace I will go unto the Lord Chri≈øt that I may be ble≈ø≈øed.</p>
               <p>Yea, My beloved, here is (me thinks) a ≈øtrong Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unto all tho≈øe that are young people for to come unto Je≈øus Chri≈øt: even tho≈øe that are very young. Hear the word of the Lord ye Children. The Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Children into his armes, and he ble≈øt them. You that are nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old; you can be ≈øolicitous for your fathers ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing, and have gone down upon your knees often unto your father, and you have ≈øaid, Pray father, pray to God to ble≈øs me. Oh! will ye go to your outward father for his ble≈ø≈øing? and will ye not go unto Je≈øus Chri≈øt? He is an Everla≈øting Father, this your earthly father will be dead erelong; He is an Everla≈øting father (children) and he is able to ble≈øs ye, and willing to ble≈øs ye. Have ye gone
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:162405:61"/>down upon your knees to your outward father? Oh! chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, down, down upon your knees before the Lord Je≈øus Chrit, and go to him for his bl≈ø≈øing. Some of you (it may be) never went yet to Chri≈øt for his ble≈ø≈øing; ye have lived ≈øo many yeers, ten, eleven, or twelve yeers, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver went to Chri≈øt as a High-Prie≈øt, for his ble≈ø≈øing all this while: Oh! what a mighty incouragement is here unto all men to come to Chri≈øt, that they may be ble≈ø≈øed by him.</p>
               <p>But yet further, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As there is an incouragement for to come unto Chri≈øt: <hi>So this argument does al≈øo incourage us to go on in the good waies of Chri≈øt, notwith≈øtanding all oppo≈øition that we meet withall:</hi> (I ≈øay) it does ≈øpeak incouragement, to go on in the face of all oppo≈øition. For when <hi>Abraham</hi> had been at battel, then came <hi>Melchi≈øedec</hi> the High-Prie≈øt to ble≈øs him: And when a poor ≈øoul goes out to battel for Chri≈øt, then comes our great <hi>Melchi≈øedec,</hi> our High-Prie≈øt, and ble≈ø≈øes that ≈øoul. The time of oppo≈øition, it is the time of Chri≈øts ble≈ø≈øing. Therefore, why ≈øhould I be dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, or beaten out of the way of Chri≈øt, by rea≈øon of any oppo≈øition, though it be never ≈øo great? Times of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition are Chri≈øts ble≈ø≈øing-time.</p>
               <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> This argument, does not only ≈øpeak incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment again≈øt all opp≈øition: <hi>But it does al≈øo incourage us to go on in the good waies of God when we are called unto it, though we have but little ≈øtrength, and weak parts.</hi> Though there be but little oyle in the Cru≈øe, though there be but little meal in the barrel, if Chri≈øt call to the work, he will ble≈øs a man in it: and when Chri≈øt ble≈ø≈øes, he does multiply and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe a mans parts in the u≈øing of them. As when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to ≈øit down, and eat, he did multiply, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe the bread in their eating: So now, does Chri≈øt call me to any work or ≈øervice, well then, though I am weak, though I have not oyle enough, though I have not meal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, though I have not ≈øtrenght enough; yet the Lord Chri≈øt will ble≈øs, and when he ble≈ø≈øes, he does increa≈øe and multiply: and therefore, why ≈øhould I not go on upon his
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:162405:61"/>work, if he do call mee thereunto, though I have never ≈øo little ≈øtrength.</p>
               <p>And yet further, If all this be true: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Why ≈øhould not a man be contented with his condition, though it be never ≈øo mean? Beloved in the Lord! is there not enough in Chri≈øts ble≈ø≈øing? Truly, He is too covetous, whom the ble≈ø≈øing of Chri≈øt will not ≈øatisfie. Well, what ever my condition be, yet I may be ble≈ø≈øed by Je≈øus Chri≈øt; and hath the Lord ble≈øt me? then will I be contented with my Condition, though it be never ≈øo mean, I have-<hi>All,</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> once≈øaid, <hi>I have All.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea in the Fift and la≈øt place: Here is that, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> (which if wel ≈øtudied and con≈øidered) will provoke us all for to ble≈øs the Lord, and continually to ble≈ø≈øe the Lord! What is the life of a Chri≈øtian here, but a continuall ble≈ø≈øing of God? 'tis Heaven begun: and in Heaven, they do nothing el≈øe, but ble≈ø≈øe and prai≈øe the Lord; and, I ≈øay, our life here, is Heaven begun: and therefore a Chri≈øtian ≈øhould be alwaies ble≈ø≈øing and prai≈øing the Lord.</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>But what will make a man to be alwaies Ble≈ø≈øing,</hi>

               <p>The greater Conde≈øeention in the per≈øon loving, to the per≈øon loved, the greater is the love.

               <p>The more Profitable any love is, to the per≈øon loved, the greater is the love.

               <p>This word <hi>Tempted,</hi> or <hi>Tempt;</hi> it is given in Scripture phra≈øe, ≈øometimes to <hi>God,</hi> ≈øometimes to <hi>Man,</hi> and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the <hi>Devil;</hi> and accordingly it is u≈øed <hi>Three waies:</hi> Sometimes it is u≈øed for to <hi>Prove;</hi> and ≈øo <hi>God</hi> is ≈øaid for to Tempt, in the 13. of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> Sometimes it is u≈øed for to <hi>Try, to make experiment of a Thing, or a Per≈øon, whom or which we did not know before;</hi> and ≈øo it is given to <hi>Man</hi> (as I take it) in the 6. of <hi>Judges.</hi> Sometimes it is u≈øed for a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation,</hi> and <hi>Drawing unto what is evil;</hi> and ≈øo it is given unto the <hi>Devil,</hi> in the 4. of <hi>Matthew, Chri≈øt was led into the axilderne≈øs to be tempted.</hi> If ye look into the Scripture, ye don't find in all the old Te≈øtament, that the word <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is given to Satan, that Satan was ≈øaid to Tempt any:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:162405:64"/>Satan did frequently Tempt, we reade in the old Te≈øtament; but I ≈øay, the word Tempt is not given unto him. Satan tempted <hi>Job,</hi> but <hi>Job's</hi> afflictions in the old Te≈øtament, are not called Satans temptations. As our Lord and Saviour Chri≈øt in the old Te≈øtament was Vail'd, the old Te≈øtament was full of Chri≈øt, yet Chri≈øt was hidden there: So was Satan and his temptations mask't. Now when the light of the glorious Go≈øpel ≈øhined more cleerly in the comming of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, as Chri≈øts vail was taken off, ≈øo Satans Mask was taken off; Satans temptations are no longer cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led afflictions, but bare Temptations, throughout the new-Te≈øtament. Indeed, this word <hi>Temptation,</hi> in the phra≈øe of the new Te≈øtament, is u≈øed ≈øometimes for <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> Sometimes for Satans <hi>Sugge≈øtions;</hi> ≈øometimes for our <hi>own Sins.

And though we our ≈øelves are ≈øaid to be tempted in all three re≈øpects, In regard <hi>of Afflictions, Satans Sugge≈øtions,</hi> and <hi>our own Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and Sins;</hi> yet when it is ≈øaid in the latter end of the ver≈øe, <hi>He is able to ≈øuccour them that are tempted;</hi> I take it to be meant e≈øpecially in he two la≈øt re≈øpects, and not in the fir≈øt: for it hath relation unto that which goes before the la≈øt ver≈øe being a rea≈øon of the latter end of the 17. ver≈ø. <hi>To make reconciliation for the ≈øins of the people, for in that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf hath ≈øuffered, being tempted, he is able to ≈øuccovr them that

               <p>Further, God doth not only ≈øuffer it thus far: but ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he ≈øuffers his children to be ≈øo far tempted, as they ≈øeem to have the wor≈øer, Satan the better; Satan taking the wall of them, the upper hand, In the 3. of <hi>Zachary,</hi> it is ≈øaid concerning <hi>Jo≈øhua: That Satan ≈øtood at his right hand:</hi> Satan took the wall of him, took the upper hand of him.</p>
               <p>La≈øtly, <hi>God ≈øuffers this to be, and to continue a long time with ≈øome of his children.

               <p>Again, This ≈øame word <hi>Touching,</hi> in Scripture Phra≈øe, ≈øometimes notes <hi>Fellow≈øhip</hi> and <hi>Communion:</hi> and ≈øo when the Apo≈øtle forbids the Corinthians fellow≈øhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Idolaters; ≈øaith he, <hi>Be ye Separate, and touch no unclean thing.</hi> Touching there noting <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>Fellow≈øhip</hi> with them in their Wor≈øhip: don't in the lea≈øt mea≈øure have any communion with them.

Surely this cannot ≈øtand with grace. But was not Je≈øus Chri≈øt tempted? Yes. But I am tempted many times to doubt of my Child-≈øhip, whether I be the Child of God, Son of God I or no. And was not Chri≈øt thus? There were Two ≈øpecial times of Chri≈øts temptation: Once when he entered upon the Mini≈øtry: Once when he went out of the world; and you ≈øhall ≈øee, how at both the≈øe times, he was followed with this temptation: In the 4. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> there you reade of the fir≈øt, and in the combate, twice, <hi>If thou be the Son of God?</hi> ≈øaies the Devil: putting an <hi>If</hi> upon his Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip: and again, <hi>If</hi> thou be the Son of God: putting an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other If upon his Son-≈øhip.

Blu≈øh, O Heavens, and be a≈øtoni≈øhed: <hi>All</hi> this will I give thee, If thou wilt fall down and wor≈øhip me. Oh! but I am tempted to depair: ≈øometimes; I confe≈ø≈øe I am able to reade Gods love, and to ≈øay, that God is with me, and I think I can ≈øay, I know that God is with me: but at another time, Oh! how unlike am I unto my ≈øelf, and I ≈øay, Mercy is gone, and Chri≈øt is gone, and hath left me as an orphan. And I pray con≈øider how it was with Chri≈øt in this re≈øpect; he went as neer to it as could be, without ≈øin. It is <hi>Mu≈øculus</hi> his Ob≈øervation. In the 16. of <hi>John: Behold</hi> (≈øaies Chri≈øt at the 32. ver≈øe) <hi>the hour cometh</hi> (≈øpeaking of his ≈øuffering hour) <hi>Yea, it is now come, when ye ≈øhall be ≈øcattered every man from his own, and ≈øhall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone becau≈øe the Father is with me.</hi> (Speaking of his ≈øuffering hour) And yet when he was upon the Cro≈ø, he ≈øaies, Father, <hi>My God, my God, why ha≈øt thou for≈øaken me?</hi> How diver≈øe does he ≈øeem to be from him≈øelf? Saies he, I am not alone, becau≈øe the Father is with me: And yet when he comes into the hour, My God, my God, why ha≈øt thou for≈øaken me? Oh! but I have ≈øuffered as much as ever any did, I have ≈øuffered by the hand of my temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they have been a continual torment to me, and I have ≈øuffered much from them. Well, but have ye ≈øuffered more than Chri≈øt ≈øuffered? It is ≈øaid in the text, <hi>For in that he ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered being tempted:</hi> What a mighty ≈øuffering was it, for the glorious God of Heaven and Earth to have ≈øuch temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thrown in upon him? any one temptation to be lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in his mind, what a mighty ≈øuffering was this? Thus you ≈øee how Chri≈øt ≈øuffered.</p>
               <p>And beloved, <hi>He ≈øuffered, and was tempted, that he might ≈øuccour you that are tempted.</hi> Will you que≈øtion his love then, becau≈øe of your temptation, or your own condition? do ye know what you do?

               </p>
               <p>There is indeed, ≈øomething of a ≈øuffering, a malignant quality, an affliction in every temptation when it takes lea≈øt: and therfore, look how you would walk under an afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ≈øo walk under your temptation. In your affliction, you will walk Humbly: ≈øo under your temptation do. In your affliction, you will examine the Cau≈øe, e≈øpecially if your affliction lie long upon you: So in your temptation do. In your affliction, you will ≈øeek God Early: So in the morning of your temptation do. In the day of your affliction, you will Engage to God; the day of affliction, is the day of engaging, and you ≈øay, Oh! if the Lord will deliver me, through his grace I will do ≈øo and ≈øo: So in your temptation do. In your affliction, you will take heed of tho≈øe ≈øins that you are mo≈øt apt unto in the time of affliction: ≈øo do in the time of your temptation: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample thus: in affliction, a man is very apt to be di≈øcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, to have his heart ≈øink and to die within him: So in temptation, take heed of that. In affliction, a man is apt ≈øo to mind his pre≈øent burden, as to forgit all his former mercy: ≈øo in the time of temptation take heed of that. In the time of affliction, a man is very apt to be froward, and impatient, to break out into frowardne≈øs, and impatiency though he did not ≈øo before: As the wood that is laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fire, ≈øends forth filth which you did not ≈øee in the wood before it came upon the fire: So men are apt to ≈øend
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:162405:70"/>forth filth, and much frowardne≈øs and impatiency in the time of affliction, when you took them for good natured people before, and thought there was no ≈øuch frowardne≈øs in them, and no ≈øuch impatiency: So in the time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation al≈øo take heed of that. In the time of affliction, men are apt to make an evil con≈øtruction, and interpretation of things: Affliction rai≈øes Pa≈ø≈øion, and Pa≈ø≈øion puts other colors upon things than formerly; and ≈øo in time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, we are apt to make ≈øtrange con≈øtructions of Gods dealings, and Chri≈øt's dealings with us: take heed of that. In time of affliction, men are apt to change their behaviour; <hi>David</hi> did ≈øo, he let fall his ≈øpittle upon his beard, and faigned him≈øelf mad; he changed his behaviour: and ≈øo are men apt to change their behaviour in times of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: take heed of that. In time of affliction, men are apt to ≈øtint, and limit God, and ≈øay, Can God provide a table now? and can God deliver now? and ≈øo al≈øo in the time of temptation, men are apt to ≈øay, Can God provide now? &amp; can God deliver now? and ≈øo ≈øtint, and limit the Holy One of I≈ørael; take heed of that. In the day of affliction a gracious heart does rather rejoyce that he hath any oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to exerci≈øe his grace, than mourn for his pre≈øent bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: ≈øo do you now. In the day of affliction, a gracious heart doth more de≈øire to be clean≈øed, than to be delivered; wi≈øhes rather that his heart may be ≈øanctified by his affliction, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> that his affliction may be removed. There is ≈øomthing of a ≈øuffering (ye have heard) in every temptation: now then, does a temptation ari≈øe, and pre≈ø≈øe in upon you; Go to the Lord and ≈øay, Lord, though I meet with hard things from the hand of my temptations, &amp; the≈øe temptations have lien long upon me: yet I do rather chu≈øe Grace than Peace; rather to be Clean≈øed, than to be Delivered: Oh! my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, how well might it be with us, if we did but improve our temptations? what againing day, what a learning day might the day of temptation be? yea, what an harve≈øt-day unto us, when Satan de≈øires to winnow us?</p>

               <p>Some again, they don't much mind their Calling to a condition, nor don't go in the ≈øtrength of their Call: whereas you ≈øhall ob≈øerve, that when <hi>Peter</hi> was called to ≈øtand before the Princes, and Rulers, he did boldly profe≈ø≈øe Chri≈øt, becau≈øe his call did lead him thereunto: but when he was not Called into the High-Prie≈øts hall, then he fals before a tempting wench.

So when <hi>David</hi> had a mind to number the people, then the Devil ≈øtands up, and provokes him to number the people ≈øutable to his own di≈øpo≈øition.

And ≈øo I ≈øay in regard of temptation: the way to avoid temptation, is not alwaies to apply a ≈øalve directly pertinent to the temptation; but turn off your mind and your thoughts to ≈øome other good objects, and by that time your mind is ≈øetled upon other objects, you will be ea≈øily able to meet with the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

That ≈øame woman that came to Chri≈øt for her daughter, ≈øhe met with great temptations: There was the temptation of her calamity; her daughter po≈ø≈øe≈øt: There was a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chri≈øts not an≈øwering, but delaying his an≈øwer. There was a temptation of Chri≈øts ≈øeeming denial; <hi>I am not ≈øent but to the lo≈øt ≈øheep of the hou≈øe of I≈ørael:</hi> There was a temptation of her own unworthine≈øs; <hi>'Tis not lawful to take the childrens bread and to ca≈øt it to dogs:</hi> yet notwith≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ≈øhe beleeves, Oh! ≈øaies our Saviour, <hi>Woman, great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</hi> And ≈øo I ≈øay, though

It was the ≈øpeech of <hi>Taulerus,</hi> one that <hi>Luther</hi> prizeth above all: Saies he, Though the Marriners may make u≈øe of their Oars in the time of calm, yet when a ≈øtorm comes down, the Marriners leave all and fly to their Anchor. So, though at other times we may make u≈øe of Re≈øolutions, and Vows, and the like; yet when the ≈øtorm of temptation comes down, nothing then, but fly to the anchor of faith, nothing then like to ca≈øting of anchor into the Vail. And as if the holy Gho≈øt, put al on this, he cals <hi>Faith</hi> our <hi>Anchor;</hi> and he cals <hi>Faith</hi> our <hi>Shield:</hi> All dangers are either Sea-dangers, or Land dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: if your dangers be <hi>Sea-dangers, Faith</hi> is your <hi>Anchor;</hi> and if your dangers be <hi>Land dangers, Faith</hi> is your <hi>Shield.</hi> And therefore I ≈øay, when temptation ari≈øes, labour then to exerci≈øe your faith, and ≈øay, Oh! how ≈øhould I do this thing, and ≈øin again≈øt my Chri≈øt, and ≈øin again≈øt my God? Satan, thou telle≈øt me, All this I will give thee, if I wil do this thing: I but, how ≈øhall I do this, and ≈øin again≈øt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt who hath loved me, and given him≈øelf for 'me?

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:162405:72"/>this Rule is: If temptation ari≈øe, don't fear too much, though the temptation be never ≈øo great: don't fear too little though the temptation be never ≈øo ≈ømall.</p>

                  <hi>If temptation do ari≈øe; Be ≈øure that you make ≈øome improvement of it for the better.</hi> If an enemy come and make an a≈ø≈øault again≈øt one of your garri≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towns, and he goes away, and gets no hurt, he is incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and invited to come again; for (≈øaies he) I lo≈øt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; though I did not gain, and carry the Town, yet I lo≈øt nothing: But now, if upon his a≈ø≈øault he lo≈øes many men, and his Ordnance, I'le come no more there (≈øaies he) for there I had ≈øuch and ≈øuch a great lo≈øte. Thus it is with Satan when he comes before a ≈øoul with his temptations; there is a ≈øoul (≈øaies he) I came before him with my temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and though indeed I did not carry it, I did not get the thing I would, yet I lo≈øt nothing, and therefore I'le go again. But there is a ≈øoul, and there's a heart, I came before him with my temptations, and I confe≈ø≈øe I lo≈øt much; I tempted and he prayed, and the more I temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the more he prayed, and the more I tempted ≈øtill, the more he did go to Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and therefore I will tempt him no more. Beloved, labour to improve your temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, goe to God with your temptations in your hands, and pray over your temptations: and if you improve your temptations, you ≈øhall not be troubled
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:162405:73"/>with Satan; and therefore you are troubled with Satan ≈øo much, becau≈øe you improve your temptations no more. Oh! how well might it be with us, if we did but improve our temptations? what a good day would this be? what a good day might be this ≈øad day of our temptation, if we did but improve our temptations? And I be≈øeech you think of it, how we may improve them more and more. You know what our Saviour ≈øaid concerning the fal≈øe ground; <hi>in the time of temptation it fell away:</hi> let that awe our hearts. You know what our ≈øaviour ≈øaies again by way of comfort unto his Di≈øciples; <hi>You continued with me in my temptations, and therefore I appoint unto you a kingdom:</hi> and ble≈ø≈øed are they that do continue, and hold out this ≈øiege. Beloved! the≈øe turning times, are tempting times: and I think I may truly ≈øay, if ever there were an hour of temptation upon this kingdom, this is the hour of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands temptation, it is an hour of temptation. Oh! you that are the ≈øervants of God, and the Di≈øciples of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, will ye not watch with him one hour? an hour of temptation it is, but this is our comfort, it is but an hour: and therefore you that are his ≈øervants and Di≈øciples, will you not watch with him one hour? Watch and pray, watch and pray: ≈øome pray, but they will not watch; and ≈øome pretend to watch, but they don't pray.

                  <hi>We will grant Chri≈øt is able to ≈øuccour tempted ≈øouls: but is he willing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes, He is infinitly willing to ≈øuccour poor tempted ≈øouls. Our great ≈øuccour lies in <hi>Reconciliation with God the Father;</hi> as by comparing the≈øe two ver≈øes together doth appear. God the father hath ≈øet him forth to be a <hi>propitiation:</hi> it was the will of God the Father, that Je≈øus Chri≈øt ≈øhould come and make propitiation, it was his will. Now, look into the 40. <hi>P≈øalm,</hi> and ≈øee what Chri≈øt ≈øaith concerning the will of the Father; ver≈øe the 7. <hi>Loe, I come: in the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum of the book it is written of me: I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy Law is within my heart:</hi> Some books reade it, <hi>Thy Law is within my bowels:</hi> thy Law is within my heart, 'tis in my de≈øires. Yea, not only (≈øaith he) in my de≈øires: but in the Go≈øpel we reade it, With de≈øiring have I de≈øired to eat this Pa≈øs-over, before he ≈øuffered. <hi>De≈øiring have I de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> And (≈øaith he) I have a <hi>bapti≈øme to be baptizeds with,</hi> and I am ≈øtraitened till it be accompli≈øh't: I can have no re≈øt till it be done, I am ≈øtraitened till it be accompli≈øhed. Yea, not only ≈øo: but (≈øaith he) here in this <hi>P≈øalm, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do thy will:</hi> 'tis the will of God he ≈øhould make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation; and ≈øo ≈øuccour: I delight to do thy will. And in the 8. of the <hi>Proverbs: My delights are with the ≈øons of men:</hi> ≈øome reade it, <hi>All my delight:</hi> but 'tis in the plural number. When God laid the foundations of the earth my <hi>delights</hi> were with the ≈øons of men. A high, and a great expre≈ø≈øion. Surely, Je≈øus Chri≈øt cannot but be willing to ≈øuccour tempted ones, when his delights are with the ≈øons of men.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>A man mu≈øt needs be willing, to do that which he is willing to ≈øuffer much for, to be at much co≈øt and pains for. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:162405:77"/>was willing to build the Temple, becau≈øe he laid out ≈øo much by way of preparation. And <hi>Araunah</hi> was willing to have a ≈øacrifice, becau≈øe he gave up his thre≈øhing-flowr, it appear'd he was willing. And now when Je≈øus Chri≈øt is content to ≈øuffer ≈øo much that he may make a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ≈øinners, and reconciliation with the Father, and ≈øo ≈øuccour; it argues that he is very willing.</p>
               <p>Be≈øides, <hi>A man is willing to have that done which he is much troubled for if it be not done.</hi> You know when Chri≈øt came to Jeru≈øalem, he wept (≈øaies the text) and he wept: He came a ≈øuccouring, and they would not be ≈øuccoured: <hi>How often would I have gathered thee as an hen gathers her chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens under her wings, and thou would≈øt not?</hi> A Hen is a ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring creature: Chri≈øt came a ≈øuccouring, came to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them as a Hen. A Hen ≈øits upon the eggs, and hatcheth with the warmth of her body: So doth Chri≈øt do with the warmth of his love. A Hen ≈øits till the feathers be off her own body, makes her own body naked for to hatch up: And ≈øo did Chri≈øt. When the chicken is hatch't, ≈øhe ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours it, and covers it under her wings: and when the chicken can run abroad, let the hen find but a grain of corn, ≈øhe clucks, and cals the chicken to her to have part of it: And ≈øo did Chri≈øt. And when danger comes, the Kite comes, ≈øhe cals the chicken under her wings again to ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour it: So does Chri≈øt. When he ≈øaies thus, he came to gather them as a Hen gathers her chickens under her wings, he came to ≈øuccour them, but they would not be ≈øuccour'd; ≈øee how he takes it: the text ≈øaies, <hi>He wept,</hi> he wept; he was much troubled. Wi≈øe men don't u≈øe to weep before company; children will: but tho≈øe that are very wi≈øe, if they will weep, they weep in private: Je≈øus Chri≈øt (that was the wi≈ødom of the Father) fals a weeping, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they would not be ≈øuccour'd; Surely then, Je≈øus Chri≈øt is very willing to ≈øuccour poor ≈øinners. And belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved! this was his love, and this was his compa≈ø≈øion in the day of his infirmity; how great is it now in the day of his glory?</p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:162405:78"/>
               <p>Again, It argues that he is very willing to ≈øuccour poor tempted ≈øouls, <hi>becau≈øe he was ≈øo willing to cure di≈øea≈øed bodies;</hi> when he was upon the earth he was willing to cure them: So willing, as though it did co≈øt a miracle, yet he would do it. So willing, that though they did not know him as he was, but thought him a Prophet, yet he would do it. So willing, as that though they did not de≈øire it them≈øelves but were brought by others, yet he would do it. So wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as that though they were unmannerly in their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him; withne≈øs the pulling the tyles off the hou≈øe, yet he would do it. And that ≈øo willing, though much unbeleef expre≈ø≈ø by tho≈øe that were brought unto him, yet he would do it. I be≈øeech you con≈øider it: this was a work that Chri≈øt came into the world to do; this is The work: the work that Chri≈øt came to do, it was <hi>to bind up broken hearts:</hi> The work that Chri≈øt came to do, was <hi>to open the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon doors to poor captives: The Spirit of the Lord is upon me</hi> (you know the place.) <hi>To admini≈øter a word in due ≈øea≈øon to tho≈øe that are weak:</hi> He hath given me the tongue of the learned to admini≈øter a word in due ≈øea≈øon to tho≈øe that are weak. Now then, if Je≈øus Chri≈øt was ≈øo willing to do the other work which was but his work by the bye, which was not <hi>The-work</hi> that he did come about: how infinitely willing mu≈øt he needs be to do <hi>The-work</hi> that he did come about? but I ≈øay, to ≈øuccour poor tempted ones, this was <hi>The-work</hi> that he came upon; Heaven hath not alter'd him, he hath lo≈øt none of his love by going thither: Surely therefore, the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt is infinitely willing to ≈øuccour poor tempted ≈øouls.</p>
               <p>Well, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>But though he be able, and willing, yet it may be he is not faithfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes, ≈øaith the former ver≈øe, <hi>Faithful:</hi> merciful, and faithful High-Prie≈øt. <hi>Faithful in all his hou≈øe as</hi> Mo≈øes <hi>was.</hi> What hone≈øt man will break his word? go contrary to his oath?

This is the work that is in his hand, to ≈øuccour tempted ones: it ≈øhall pro≈øper in his hand. In the 8. Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> We reade there at the 16. ver≈øe, That he ca≈øt out ≈øpirits with his Word, and healed all that were ≈øick: That is might be fulfilled which was ≈øpoken by <hi>E≈øai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> the Prophet, ≈øaying, <hi>Him≈øelf took our infirmities, and bare our ≈øickne≈ø≈øes.</hi> Becau≈øe he took our infirmities, and bare our ≈øickne≈ø≈øes, he took him≈øelf to be engaged for to heal the ≈øickne≈ø≈øes, and di≈øea≈øes among the people.

                  <hi>How doth he ≈øuccour tho≈øe that are tempted, in the day and time of their temptation?</hi> (that is the Fourth thing.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ≈øuccours Before temptation: He ≈øuccours In temptation: He ≈øuccours After temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chri≈øt ≈øuccours tempted ≈øouls Before the temptation comes; ≈øometimes:</hi> By a ≈øpecial manife≈øtation of him≈øelf, ihs love, and fulne≈øs to them.

               </p>
               <p>Sometimes he ≈øuccours <hi>Before temptation;</hi> By laying in of Go≈øpel-principles, and Go≈øpel-di≈øpo≈øitions in the heart. <hi>The Law is weak,</hi> ≈øaies the Apo≈øtle. As it is weak unto the point of Ju≈øtification, the matter of Ju≈øtification; ≈øo a legal di≈øpo≈øition is weak as to the matter of re≈øi≈øting temptation: a Go≈øpel-di≈øpo≈øition is able to bear it off.

               <p>Again, He ≈øuccours <hi>Before the temptation: By filling the heart with the holy Gho≈øt.</hi> When the ve≈ø≈øel is fild with one liquor, it keeps out another. I will return to my hou≈øe (≈øaith Satan) and I came and found it empty; and ≈øo he entered. The Lord therfore, fils the hou≈øe, the ≈øoul with the holy Gho≈øt, and ≈øo keeps Satan from entering.</p>
               <p>He ≈øuccours al≈øo, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nder temptation:</hi> By opening the eyes of him that is tempted to ≈øee that 'tis but a temptation. <hi>A temptation is half cured, when a man knows that 'tis but a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi> when a mans eyes is open to ≈øee the tempter, and the temptation.

                  <p>Beloved! Either there is a truth in this Doctrine; or el≈øe there is not. If there be not, what mean all the proofs that ye have had? And if there be a truth, if the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt be a ≈øuccouring Chri≈øt to tempted ≈øouls; why then ≈øhould you not triumph in him? and ≈øay, Well, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ≈øhall ≈øeparate me from the love of God in Je≈øus Chri≈øt:

                     </label> Why does he ≈øay el≈øe, <hi>That in all the≈øe things we are more than conquerers?</hi> There is an adver≈øary power in this. And what think you when he ≈øaies, <hi>That neither life, nor death, nor Angels, nor principalities, and powers?</hi> Does not the Devil come in there, under principalities and powers?

You that are the tempted Saints of God, do not your hearts burn, and glow within you with love to Je≈øus Chri≈øt? and will you que≈øtion his love to you? Did Chri≈øt Come and

There's never a temptation but you are beleaguer'd by it: and when your temptation is about you, ≈øay, O my ≈øoul, be quiet, yeeld not; the Lord Chri≈øt is a ≈øuccouring Chri≈øt, and ≈øuccour will come, and therefore hold it out.

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:162405:84"/>live upon the letter of the Promi≈øe.</hi> I mean, don't live upon the Conveyance, but upon the Land: and yet how many do live upon the bare Promi≈øe, bare letter of the Promi≈øe. When a temptation comes, pa≈ø≈øe from the temptation unto the Promi≈øe; and through the Promi≈øe unto Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and learn to live upon the thing Promi≈øed, and not the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Promi≈øe.</p>
                  <p>After temptation is over, (I can but touch on things) Either you have the better of Satan: Or el≈øe the wor≈øe. If you have the wor≈øe; Be for ever Humbled, but never Di≈øcouraged. And if you have the better of him: Then rejoyce in the Lord, and in all his goodne≈øs toward you, and in all his ≈øuccouring love and mercy. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord evermore, and again I ≈øay, rejoyce. As one whom his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comforteth, ≈øo will I comfort you:</hi> and then it follows, <hi>They ≈øhall rejoyce; your hearts ≈øhall rejoyce. But take heed your ≈øpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all joy after Victory, don't degenerate into carnal joy, and you be drunk therewith.</hi> 'Tis reported of the Engli≈øh, that once going into Spain, and taking in a Town there: after they had taken it in, there being much wine in the Town, the ≈øouldiers fell a drinking of them≈øelves drunk; and the Country came down upon them, and beat them out, and recovered the Town again. So 'tis with many: They have a Victory over temptation, and they begin to rejoyce ≈øpiritually; but their ≈øpiritual joy degenerates into carnal joy, and they are drunk with their joy, and ≈øo lo≈øe their Victory. Beloved! <hi>Joy not in your Joy, but in the God of your Joy after Victory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if you have the better after temptation, if you have the better: be ≈øure of this, <hi>That you improve your Victory to more a≈ø≈øurance.</hi> If the Devil get the better of you, he'le be ≈øure to improve his Victory to your de≈øpair: I ≈øay, if he get the better of you, he will be ≈øure to improve his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to your de≈øpair. Therefore, if you get the better of him be ≈øure that you improve your Victory, to more a≈ø≈øurance of Gods love in Chri≈øt.</p>
                  <p>Yea, (my beloved) for ought I know, there is no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:162405:85"/>that a child of God meets withal, but he may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it to more a≈ø≈øurance. As thus:</p>
                  <p>Surely, If I were the Devils own, he would never trouble me thus. When the ≈øtrong man keeps the hou≈øe, all is at peace, and all is at quiet. Now ever ≈øince, from the very fir≈øt day that I have ≈øet my face towards heaven, and Chri≈øt; Oh! how have I been troubled, and tempted, and perplexed, and vexed in my ≈øpirit? Surely therefore, I am none of the Devils. Now if I had been his own, I ≈øhould have been more quiet under him: but becau≈øe I am thus troubled. I hope in the Lord I am none of the Devils, I am the child of God. Thus a man may improve.</p>
                  <p>And, Oh! what a good thing were it, if we did make improvement of our temptations! what gracious improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might we make of all our temptations? and what a ble≈ø≈øed i≈ø≈øue might we have in our temptations, if we did go unto Chri≈øt for ≈øuccour.</p>
                  <p>I be≈øeech you therefore in the Lord, when as any temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ari≈øes, <hi>go unto Je≈øus Chri≈øt, he is a ≈øuccouring Chri≈øt.</hi> He hath National ≈øuccours; and he hath Family ≈øuccours; and he hath Per≈øonal ≈øuccours: You have National temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; and you have Family temptations; and you have Per≈øonal temptations; Soul-temptations; temptations when you are alone. Therefore go unto Chri≈øt for ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I be≈øeech you (beloved in the Lord) go to Chri≈øt and try him, put him to it: The greater your temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is, the more fit work for Chri≈øt to cure: do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpair, do not ≈øit down; go to Je≈øus Chri≈øt, you ≈øhal find him better than I have ≈øpoken, you ≈øhall not find him wor≈øe; he will go beyond my words, he will not fall ≈øhort of my words. As the Devill goes about like a roaring lyon, ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king whom he may devour: So Je≈øus Chri≈øt in the Go≈øpel, goes up and down with his ≈øuccour, ≈øeeking whom he may ≈øuccour. Go to him for ≈øuccour: and the God of peace, even Je≈øus Chri≈øt him≈øelf, tread down Satan under our feet ≈øhortly.</p>

The holy Gho≈øt is ≈øaid <hi>to enlighten a man:</hi> Satan is ≈øaid for <hi>to blind him, The god of this world hath blinded their eyes;</hi> ≈øaies the Apo≈øtle. The Spirit is ≈øaid to <hi>Rule in us;</hi> Satan is ≈øaid, <hi>To rule in the children of di≈øobedience.</hi> The holy Cho≈øt is ≈øaid, <hi>To work in us mightily,</hi> the ≈øame word is u≈øed for Him al≈øo. The holy Gho≈øt is ≈øaid, <hi>To fill the hearts of beleevers;</hi> They were <hi>filled with the holy Gho≈øt:</hi> So are mens hearts ≈øaid, To be <hi>filled with Satan:</hi> Saies <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Ananias, why hath Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan filled thine heart?</hi> Indeed, there are three things e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, wherein he does fal ≈øhort: for though Satan is able to di≈øcern what temptations would take be≈øt with a man, yet he don't know mans thoughts, for God only is the knower of ones thoughts; that is Gods prerogative. And though Satan may work very effectually in the children of di≈øobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, yet notwith≈øtanding, he does not work with an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power. When the Lord converts a man, he puts forth an Almighty power in mans conver≈øion. The ≈øame power (≈øaies the Apo≈øtle) <hi>that rai≈øed up Chri≈øt from the dead, makes ye to beleeve. The Devil is Magnipotent</hi> (≈øaies <hi>Luther</hi>) <hi>but not Omnipotent:</hi> the Devil may be very powerful, but he is not Almighty: neither does he put forht an Almighty power in his temptations, as God does in the conver≈øion of a ≈øinner. And though he may ≈øugge≈øt, and provoke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what is evil, he cannot force, or determine any man to evil. And therefore ≈øaies the Apo≈øtle <hi>Peter, why hath Satan filled thine beart?</hi> he asked <hi>Ananias</hi> that que≈øtion, becau≈øe Satan, though he did fill his heart, he could not have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, or determined him without his own will thereunto. But very powerful Satan is. In the 6. chapter to the <hi>Ephe≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>

                  </label> for they are the Saints that the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks of here, in that to the <hi>Ephe≈øians; For we wre≈øile not again≈øt fle≈øh and blood.</hi> You that are Ephe≈øians, and you that are Saints We wre≈øtle not again≈øt fle≈øh and blood, <hi>but again≈øt principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and powers.</hi> Properly, ye don't wre≈øtle with a man that is down; ye wre≈øtle with a man for to throw him down; but he mu≈øt be a ≈øtanding man that ye wre≈øtle withal: ye don't wre≈øtle with one that does run away but one that ≈øtands to it. Now all wicked men, they are down, but the Saints they ≈øtand, and they labour to throw Satan down, and Satan labours to lay them all along in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: but they properly do wre≈øtle with Satan, for they ≈øtand, the other are fallen already.</p>
               <p>Yea, the Saints are not only tempted by Satan; but the

               <p>Yea, it is po≈ø≈øible for one of Gods own children to be ≈øo far oppre≈øt with Satan, that he may even be weary of his life.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>2</label> Satan knows, that if he can but make Gods people, and the be≈øt of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren fall; though they ≈øhould not be damn'd, but pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that their fall ≈øhall be ≈øtumbling blocks unto others that may be damn'd. And therefore, I pray mark, how it is carried concerning <hi>Dauid:</hi> it is ≈øaid, in the 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. chapter, and the 1. ver≈øe. <hi>That, Satan ≈øtood up again≈øt I≈ørael
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:162405:88"/>to provoke</hi> David <hi>to number I≈ørael.</hi> It is not ≈øaid thus, And Satan ≈øtood up again≈øt <hi>David,</hi> and provoked <hi>David</hi> to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I≈ørael: no, but thus, And Satan ≈øood up again≈øt I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and provoked <hi>David</hi> to number the people: he ≈øtood up again≈øt I≈ørael; why? becau≈øe he know, that if he did make <hi>David</hi> thus to number the people, it would be a ≈øtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling for all I≈ørael, and all I≈ørael ≈øhould fare the wor≈øe by it. When Satan ≈øtands up, and tempts the ma≈øter of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily unto ≈øin, he does not barely ≈øtand up again≈øt him, but in tempting him, he ≈øtands up again≈øt all the family. When Satan tempts a religious holy man, a beloved Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Chri≈øt in a Town, Satan ≈øtands up again≈øt all the Town in tempting that one man. He ≈øtood up again≈øt I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and tempted <hi>David</hi> to number the people: and ≈øo when he tempts tho≈øe that are the mo≈øt beloved Di≈øciples of Chri≈øt, he ≈øtands up again≈øt others; and therefore though Satan knows, that their ≈øins ≈øhall be pardoned, yet he does follow them with ≈øad and ≈øore temptations. <label type="milestone">

               <p>Thirdly: <hi>Satan</hi> loves to divide between friends: he is the great <hi>make-bait of the world,</hi> he loves to divide. He may know, that there is ≈øo much goodne≈øs between man and wife, that he ≈øhal never part them; and yet he will labour to ≈øow di≈øcord between them, that they may live uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably. And ≈øo, though he knows he ≈øhall never part Chri≈øt and a poor beleever; yet he will labour to throw jealou≈øies into the heart of a beleever concerning the love of Chri≈øt. He knew well enough what was ≈øaid concerning our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chri≈øt: What was ≈øaid by the Angels at the birth of Chri≈øt; what was ≈øaid by the Angel to <hi>Mary;</hi> what was ≈øaid by <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> he heard what was ≈øaid from Heaven, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea≈øed:</hi> and yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently he comes to Chri≈øt with an If: <hi>If thou be the Son of God:</hi> laboring to throw a jealou≈øy into the heart of Chri≈øt, and to doubt of his Son-≈øhip, even with God the Father. So I ≈øay, although Satan ≈øhould know, that the Lord will pardon ≈øuch of ≈øuch a man, yet he loves to make a divi≈øion between God and the ≈øoul, and to ca≈øt in jealu≈øies between</p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:162405:89"/>
               <p>Chri≈øt and a beleever. As for others (≈øaies he) they are my own already, I ≈øhal not need to break into that hou≈øe, there is nothing but chaffe lies there; but here's a godly man, and here's trea≈øure; and therefore he does e≈øpecially lay his battery again≈øt the Satines, and tho≈øe that are the mo≈øt beloved Di≈øciples of Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>But you will ≈øay unto me, <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>How does Satan come by this tempting power; this infe≈øting, and mole≈øting power?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great is the power (as we have read already) that he hath as he is a Superiour creature:<note place="margin">Au≈øw.</note> but Satan hath yet another power, and that is the power of Conque≈øt; for in <hi>Adams</hi> fall, Satan conquered the whol world, all man-kind, they were the Devils conque≈øt upon the fall. When a man is Converted, and trun'd to God, then he comes out of the kingdom of Satan. But I ≈øay, upon the fall the Devil made a conque≈øt upon all man-kind, and ≈øo by conque≈øt he hath a great power. Satan hath heave from God the Father to tempt; I don't ≈øay, that he hath a ≈øpecial leave for every temptation, not a ≈øpecial commi≈ø≈øion, or permi≈ø≈øion, or leave for every temptation; but there is no great, or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary temptation that does fall upon the children of God, but Satan hath a ≈øpecial leave from God the Father for it. There was a ≈øpecial temptation upon the Country, in his running their herd of ≈øwine into the Sea, and he had leave for that before he did it. There was a ≈øpecial temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon <hi>Ahab,</hi> in the lying ≈øpirit of the Prophets, and he had a ≈øpecial leave, and permi≈ø≈øion from God for that. There was a ≈øpecial temptation upon <hi>Job,</hi> and he had a leave for that. Here was a ≈øpecial temptation coming down upon the Di≈øciples, and he had leave for that. Simon, Simon, <hi>Satan hath de≈øired you.</hi> He was fain to ask leave, and he had leave for that. There is no extraordinary, or great temptation befals any of the children of God, but Satan is fain to ask leave for it: he hath a leave for it, before he can come and tmept the ≈øoul.</p>
               <p>But you will ≈øa then unto me, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Que≈øt. </seg>4</label> 
                  <hi>Why does God the Father give Satan leave thus to tempt his own Children, and Chri≈øts own Di≈øciples?</hi>

               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:162405:89"/>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>1</label> and the i≈ø≈øue of any evil which befals the children of God, that was the de≈øign of God the Father, in ≈øuffering that evil to come upon them. Now the end, and i≈ø≈øue of the Saints tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is alwaies good unto them; and therefore God ≈øuffers the temptations of his people, becau≈øe he hath a de≈øign of mercy, and love upon them in the≈øe temptations. What was the end, and i≈ø≈øue of Satans tempting of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve?</hi> They fell and then the righteou≈øne≈øs of Chri≈øt, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life thereby was brought in: this was the end and the i≈ø≈øue of it. Now God the Father had this de≈øign upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans temptation, all the while Satan was tempting of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi> and the Lord would never have ≈øuffered our heel to have been brui≈øed by Satans temptation, but that he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to break the head of Satan. It was a great temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that of <hi>David,</hi> when as Satan ≈øtood up, and provoked him to number the people: pray, what was the end, and i≈ø≈øue of that temptation? I ≈øhall only name the Scriptures: The 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> the 21. chapter: and the 22. chapter and the beginning of it, and the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> the 3. chapter, and 1. ver≈øe, compared together, you ≈øhall find this: Fir≈øt Satan tempts <hi>David;</hi> he numbers the people, the people being numbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, a plague breaks forth: the plague prevailing, <hi>David</hi> goes and offers up a ≈øacrifice at the thre≈øhing flowre of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan; and there God told him the temple ≈øhould be built. <hi>David</hi> had a long time de≈øired to know where the Temple ≈øhould be built: he ≈øaies, he would give no re≈øt unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, no ≈øleep unto his eye-lids, until he had found out a place for God: you ≈øhall find, that <hi>David</hi> had this place di≈øcovered as the i≈ø≈øue of this temptation, this was the i≈ø≈øue of it, the Devil had as good have let <hi>David</hi> alone, he had as good have been quiet, for <hi>David</hi> now had the end &amp; the i≈ø≈øue, attain'd unto that, that he never did attain unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. So I ≈øay it is with the people of God, the Lord ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øuffers his own children to fall into any ≈øin, but he does intend to wean them from that ≈øin that they do fall into, even by the falling into it: the Lord never ≈øuffers any of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:162405:90"/>his own children to be tempted, but he intends to break the back of that temptation, even by their being tempted. This is the de≈øign of God the father: Oh! what a glorious de≈øign of love, and mercy is here upon all the temptations of Gods people!</p>
               <p>But God hath yet greater, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>2</label> and higher de≈øigns: The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife≈øtation of his own Power; of his own Wi≈ødom; of his own Faithfulne≈øs; of his own Love and Free grace.</p>
               <p>The manife≈øtation of his Power. When <hi>Paul</hi> was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and buffeted by Satan, the Lord ≈øaid unto him, <hi>That his ≈øirength ≈øhould be perfected in weakne≈øs:</hi> in <hi>Pauls</hi> weakne≈øs, Gods ≈øtrength ≈øhould be perfected.</p>
               <p>The manife≈øtation of his Wi≈ødom, <hi>The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation,</hi> ≈øaies the Apo≈øtle.</p>
               <p>The manife≈øtation of his Faithfulne≈øs. In the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>The Lord is faithful, and will not ≈øuffer ye to be tempted above what ye are able to bear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The manife≈øtation of his Free-love and grace. And therefore, when <hi>Paul</hi> was tempted and bufferted by Satan, and prayed again≈øt his temptation, the Lord an≈øwered thus: <hi>My grace is ≈øufficient for thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in regard of the Saints them≈øelves: How ≈øhould they give a Probate, or Te≈øtimony of their uprightne≈øs, and ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, their firm, and fa≈øt cleaving to God, if they were never tempted: reade for this purpo≈øe, the 13. of <hi>Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and the 2. and 3. ver≈øes. Before <hi>Job</hi> was tempted, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan thought that <hi>Job</hi> had ≈øerved God for a boone, for ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: <hi>Ha≈øt thou not ≈øeen my ≈øervant Job</hi> (≈øaies God) I, ≈øaies Satan, but <hi>does Job ≈øerve God for naught?

And ju≈øt thus is the language of the Devil now: Does ≈øuch a man or woman ≈øerve God for naught? he is but an Hypocrite, all things go well with him, he was never yet tempted: but, O Lord, let this man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:162405:90"/>come under my hand, and let me tempt him a little, and ≈øee if he don't bla≈øpheme.

Oh! but, I don't conclude (will ≈øome ≈øay) that I am not the child of God, I don't conclude that the Lord does not love me becau≈øe I am tempted, but becau≈øe I meet with ≈øuch and ≈øuch temptations.

                  <p>Take now Temptation according to the propriety of the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:162405:91"/>≈øpeech and phra≈øe, and ≈øo wicked men are not ≈øaid to be tempted by Satan; by their own hearts they are, but I ≈øpeak of Satans temptations, properly the wicked are not ≈øaid to be tempted by Satan. He is ≈øaid to rule in them, in the children of di≈øobedience; and he is ≈øaid to lead them captive at his will: but if ye look into the new Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ye will not ordinarily find, that wicked men are ≈øaid to be tempted by Satan. A man does not tempt his wife, but when he ≈øolicites another woman, then he is ≈øaid for to tempt that woman. As the Sains are married to Chri≈øt, ≈øo wicked men, they are match't to Satan; and he is not in propriety of phra≈øe ≈øaid for to tempt them. Your men ≈øtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, tho≈øe that ≈øteal children, they don't tempt their own children for to go with them, they naturally go with their father: but they come and tempt your children, they are other folkes children that they tempt. And ≈øo Satan, he is properly ≈øaid to tempt tho≈øe that are none of his children. A Ma≈øter don't tempt his ≈øervant, he is not ≈øaid properly to tempt his won ≈øervant to dwell with him, or to ≈øerve him; but he goes to another mans ≈øervant, and ≈øpeaks to him to come and dwell with him, and to ≈øerve him. As for wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, they are properly the ≈øervants of Satan; and therefore when the Devil ≈øolicites them to do that which is evill, or to dwell with him, and to conver≈øe with him, 'tis not I ≈øay in propriety of ≈øpeech a proper temptation: but for the ≈øervants of Chri≈øt, when he ≈øolicites them unto evil, then he is properly ≈øaid to tempt them. This for the form of a temptation.</p>
                  <p>But now, take a temptation in the <hi>Materiality</hi> of it, for the Matter of it, which is a ≈øolicitation to evil; and ≈øo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men are tempted by Satan; yea, they are more temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than the godly are; that is, they are more ≈øolicited un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to evil by Satan; and the ≈øame temptation that godly men are tempted with, wicked men are tempted with: and the ≈øame temptation that wicked men are tempted with, a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man is tempted with. As there is no Duty which a godly man does performe, but a wicked man may do it,

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>3</label> That there is no great ≈øin that the Saints do fall into, but Satan hath a ≈øpeciall hand in it: Yet it is the property and di≈øpo≈øition of Gods people to be humbled and grieved under their temptations as if they were all their own and nothing of Satans. <hi>Peter</hi> goes out and weeps bitterly when he had fallen; He might have ≈øaid thus: The Lord told me that there was a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:162405:93"/>coming, Satan had de≈øired to winnow me; and now the word of the Lord is fulfilled, Satan hath tempted me, and I am thus fallen: But not a word of Satan, but he goes out and weeps bitterly, as if it were all his own work. And let me tell you for your comfort, When as you can mourn over your temptations, as if they were all your own, and nothing of Satans, the Lord will pardon them to you, as if they were all Satans, and nothing of your own.</p>
                  <p>In the Fourth place, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>4</label> to ≈øpeak a little of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the≈øe that ye may know the difference between the temptations of Satan, and the corruptions of your own heart.</p>
                  <p>When as your heart, and your fle≈øh trembles and quakes under the fir≈øt ri≈øing, and motion of a ≈øin, this is not your own corruption alone, but there is a temptation with it. When the corruptions of ones own heart does work up evil, a mans heart is rather plea≈øed and tickled with it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øents to it, then any way ones fle≈øh lie trembling, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king under it. That temptation is not much to be feared, when a man fears him≈øelf for his temptation. He is to be feared mo≈øt, that does fear lea≈øt: and he is to be feared lea≈øt, that does fear mo≈øt. A godly, gracious, man or woman, is humbled under nothing more than under his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; he looks upon his temptations as the greate≈øt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in all the world. As now, take that of Bla≈øphemous Thoughts; Suppo≈øe a poor ≈øoul troubled with ≈øuch evill thoughts, ≈øuch a poor ≈øoul ≈øaies, I do profe≈ø≈øe it in the ≈øight of God, I never met with ≈øuch an affliction ≈øince I was born: I have lo≈øt Children; Oh! but that affliction is not like to this: I have lo≈øt friends; Oh! but that affliction is not like to this: I have lo≈øt my E≈øtate; Oh! but that affliction is not like to this. Man or woman, if it be thy affliction, 'tis not thy ≈øin. And I appeal to you now, you that ≈øay, ye don't doubt of Gods love, ye don't fear your own condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion becau≈øe of temptations only, but becau≈øe ye are afraid they are the corruptions of your own heart, and not the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:162405:93"/>temptations of Satan; I appeal to you that ≈øay ≈øo; Are ye not afraid in your ≈øelves becau≈øe of your temptations? Don't ye look upon your temptations as your greate≈øt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions? Nay, does not thy fle≈øh quake, and tremble ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when a temptation da≈øhes, and beats in upon thy ≈øoul? does not thy very outward man, ≈øometimes, lie qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and trembling, before a temptation? Certainly, this is not all the corruption of thine own heart, here's the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils hand, here's a temptation in it, and, poor ≈øoul, thou maie≈øt have ≈øome comfort yet; notwith≈øtanding the oppre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion is ≈øo great, yet here is comfort, 'tis no other but what may ≈øtand with grace.</p>

                  <p>Is it not a ≈øweet comfort, for a man to know, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy is overcome before he ≈øtrikes? Satans temptation is overcome by Chri≈øts Interce≈ø≈øion; and Chri≈øt prayes before Satan tempts; <hi>But I have prayed for thee:</hi> before the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation came.</p>
                  <p>Is it not a choice comfort, for a man to know, that Satan

                  <p>Is it not wonderful comfort, for a man to know, that there is ≈øomething that he can never be robbed of?

And ≈øo ≈øaies a child of God (or at lea≈øt he may ≈øay ≈øo) when Satan comes and tempts him, and robs him of ≈øome comfort; yet ble≈ø≈øed be the Lord, I have Union with Chri≈øt that I can never be robbed of; and I have an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in Heaven that theeves cannot break through and ≈øteal away.

When Satan tempts as a Serpent; then he does make a tender, and an offer of ≈øome comfortable, profitable, ≈øweet thing: You ≈øhall be like God; <hi>You ≈øhall be as God,</hi> ≈øaies he unto <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> when he tempted as a Serpent, came as a Serpent. And ≈øo dealing as a Serpent with our Saviour Chri≈øt, <hi>All this will I give thee if thou wilt fall down and wor≈øhip me.</hi> Shews him the glory of the world, and all this will I give thee. So ≈øaies he unto a poor ≈øoul, when he tempts as a Serpent, Come and yeeld unto this temptation, and all this comfort will I give thee, and all this profit will I give thee, and all this repute and honor will I give thee. Thus as a Serpent. Sometimes he tempts as a Lyon: for he goes up and down as a <hi>roaring Lyon,</hi> ≈øeeking whom he may devour. And when Satan tempts as a Lyon, then he does roare upon a poor ≈øoul, and labours to ≈øcare him out
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:162405:95"/>of his con≈øcience, and out of the good waies of God. And therefore in the book of the <hi>Revelation, Satan ≈øhall ca≈øt ≈øome of you into pri≈øon.</hi> Satan ≈øhall do it. And ≈øometimes he does ≈øtand and rattle the chaines of a pri≈øon; Look, do ye hear the≈øe? If you will go on in ≈øuch and ≈øuch a way, you wil lo≈øe al your friends; &amp; if you will go on in ≈øuch a way, I wil make it too hot for you, and thus and thus ≈øhall you ≈øuffer, and it ≈øhall co≈øt ye a pri≈øon ere I have done with you. Thus now Satan tempts as a Lyon, by holding terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble objects before a man. It is ≈øaid, That Satan came to our Saviour Chri≈øt, and he found nothing in him; ≈øo he prevailed not: But Satan comes to us, and he finds a great deal in us, he finds a di≈øpo≈øition in us to be moved with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of love, unto comfortable, and profitable things: He comes to us, and finds in us a di≈øpo≈øition to be moved with Fear by terrible objects. Wherefore now (my beloved) do you de≈øire to prevent the mi≈øchief of a temptation? Oh! labour more and more to die unto all the objects of your outward Love, and the objects of Fear; Die to the objects of Love, get your heart mortified to the≈øe two objects of Love and Fear. And be ≈øure of this, if thou would≈øt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent temptation, that ye labour more and more to walk in the light: Satan is the prince of darkne≈øs, and he walks in darkne≈øs: and he tempts in darkne≈øs. <hi>When night comes the bea≈øts go forth to their prey,</hi> ≈øaies the P≈øalmi≈øt, And when Satan ≈øees a poor ignorant ≈øoul, that walks in the dark, ≈øaies he, Here's a fit prey for me. Oh! therefore, you that are ignorant, and have ≈øate ignorant under the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for the Lords ≈øake, labour to get more light, and more knowledge, get your heart opened unto every truth of God, labour to acquaint your ≈øelves more with Go≈øpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and ≈øet your bo≈øomes open unto every truth of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>And, beloved! whether you would overcome, or wha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you would prevent temptation; what ever means you u≈øe; be ≈øure of this, <hi>That you take your temptation and dip it in the blood of Chri≈øt.</hi> Take a candle, that is lighted, and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:162405:96"/>only blow out the candle, the candle is ea≈øily lighted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: but when the candle is out, take it and put it into the water, and then 'tis not ≈øo ea≈øily lighted again: So now a temptation comes, and you blow it out with a Re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and you won't yeeld to it, alas, 'tis ea≈øily lighted again: but now, take this candle, take this temptation, and come and dip it in the blood of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and it will not be ≈øo ea≈øily lighted again; ≈øo you ≈øhall be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent temptation for the time to come: <hi>Never re≈øt alone in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolving, but, Oh! take your temptation and dip it in the blood of Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if that you do overcome your temptation at any time; be thankful to God: if ye have more than fle≈øh and blood again≈øt you, ye ≈øhall have more then fle≈øh and blood with you. And therefore, have you overcome temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? go away and be very thankful, and ≈øay, Oh! though fle≈øh and blood be again≈øt me, yet I have more than fle≈øh and blood with me, prai≈øe the Lord much: And if you have been overcome with temptation, yet be not di≈øcouraged; for ye hear the Doctrine, God doth ≈øuffer his own dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be tempted, to be buffeted, to be expo≈øed to Satans temptings, and to Satans winnowings. But though ye be tempted, and it be a temptation of Satan, yet ye hear withall, That 'tis the property, and di≈øpo≈øition of Gods own people to grieve, and mourn under their temptation as if it were all their own, and nothing of Satans.

Every day we turn unto God yet more and more; every day brings forth another conver≈øion: yet not ≈øo, as if the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øion were made void. And if the faith of a beleever would fail totally in the time of a temptation; what ≈øhould be the meaning of tho≈øe words, in the 1. of <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. Chapter, and the 18. ver≈øe. We know, that <hi>who≈øoever is born of God ≈øins not;</hi> but <hi>he that is begotten of God, keepeth him≈øelf, and that wicked one toucheth him not:</hi> The wicked one: that is <hi>Satan,</hi> he toucheth him not. But now, if Satan could tempt a godly man, and prevail ≈øo far in his temptation, as to make his faith fail totally, then he would touch him to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe: but (≈øaies the text) he keeps him≈øelf, and the wicked one toucheth him not: and therefore his faith cannot fail totally, a regenerate mans faith cannot fail totally. And ye know what is ≈øaid, in that 7. of <hi>Matthew</hi> at the 24. and 25. ver≈øes. <hi>Who≈øoever heareth the≈øe ≈øayings of mine, and doth
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:162405:98"/>them, I will liken him unto a wi≈øe man, which hath built his hou≈øe upon a rock; and the rain de≈øcended, and the flouds came, and the winds blew and beat upon that hou≈øe; and it fell not, becau≈øe it was founded upon a rock.</hi> Now every Beleever is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a rock, <hi>(Chri≈øt)</hi> and therefore, though the rain de≈øcend, and the flouds come, and the winds blow, and temptations be never ≈øo great, he cannot fail totally, becau≈øe he is built upon a rock. In the 13. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> ye know it is made the property of the fal≈øe ground, that in the time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it fell away: Now if the good ground (a regenerate man) ≈øhould fall away in the time of temptation; what difference were there between the fal≈øe ground, &amp; the good ground? Plainly therefore, the Scripture holds forth this truth unto us, That a regenerate man, a Beleever, though his faith may fail much, yet it does not fail totally in time of temptation. And thus <hi>Peters</hi> faith failed, and thus it failed not: In regard of the Exerci≈øe, and Acting of his faith, it did fail; but in regard of the grace it ≈øelf, faith it ≈øelf, ≈øo it failed not: and ≈øo it is, and may be with others of the Saints al≈øo.</p>

                  <hi>If the faith of a beleever do only fail in regard of the Acting, Exerci≈øe, and Working thereof, What great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience is there, or evil in the failing of his faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much, (my beloved) very much: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>
                  </label> For though that faith fail only in regard of the Acting, Exerci≈øe, and working, he does lo≈øe an opportunity of glorifying God. 'Tis ≈øaid of <hi>Abraham, That he beleeved, and gave glory to God.</hi> Faith gives glory to God: it glorifies his Power, his Mercy, his Faithfulne≈øs, and his Wi≈ødom; not faith in the Habit, but faith in the Exerci≈øe of it glorifies God: and ≈øo much as a mans faith doth fail, in the Acting, Working, and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øe of it, ≈øo much he lo≈øeth an opportunity of glorifying God.</p>
               <p>Moreover, He lo≈øes his own Comfort. Faith is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting grace. <hi>Being ju≈øtified by faith, we have peace with God.</hi> And in the 15. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the 13. ver≈øe, ye find, That Joy and Peace grows upon faith: <hi>Now the God of hope,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:162405:98"/>fill ye with all Joy and Peace in beleeving.</hi> So much as a man does beleeve, ≈øo much Joy and Peace: if a man fail in the Exerci≈øe of his faith, he does lo≈øe his Comfort.</p>
               <p>Yea, hereby al≈øo, <hi>he does lo≈øe his pre≈øent prize.</hi> A Chri≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath a prize in this life; he hath a two-fold crown: A crown of glory in the world to come; and a pre≈øent crown. And therefore ≈øaies the Lord unto the Church of <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, Hold fa≈øt that which thou ha≈øt, le≈øt another take thy crown.</hi> Now if a man do fail in the Exerci≈øe of his faith, he does lo≈øe much of his pre≈øent prize. Ye know how it was with <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and <hi>Aron,</hi> ye reade of it in the 20. chapter of <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> and the 12. ver≈øe. <hi>And the Lord ≈øpake unto</hi> Mo≈øes <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>Becau≈øe ye beleeve me not, to ≈øanctifie me in the eyes of the children of I≈ørael; therefore ye ≈øhall not bring this congregation into the land which I have promi≈øed them.</hi> They were ≈øhut out of the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for not beleeving. But <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> &amp; <hi>Araon</hi> did not lo≈øe the grace of faith, it was only failing in the Exerci≈øe of faith; their failing was not in the grace it ≈øelf, but only they failed, in the Exerci≈øe of their faith, and they were ≈øhut out of <hi>Canaan</hi> for it. And <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> be≈øought the Lord earne≈øtly in prayer, that he would rever≈øe this threatning, and it might not be; he was ≈øhut out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> meerly for failing in the Exerci≈øe of his faith. Oh! what an evil thing is it then, for a Chri≈øtian to fail in his faith, though it be no more than in the Exerci≈øe of his faith.</p>
               <p>Further, In this failing of ones faith, though but in the Exerci≈øe of it; <hi>A Chri≈øtian does lo≈øe much of the benefit, and ≈øweetne≈øs of the mercy promi≈øed.</hi> Look as it is with a wicked man, in regard of the judgment threatned; So with a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man in regard of the mercy promi≈øed. Now take a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, and let the threatning of God be fulfilled before him upon others, upon him≈øelf; he profits not by Gods judgments. Why? becau≈øe that he don't exerci≈øe faith concerning the threatning; and ≈øo when the judgment comes, he profits not by Gods dealing, by Gods judgments, he lo≈øes the benefit of Gods di≈øpen≈øations that way. So I ≈øay with a godly man: let the promi≈øe be fulfilled, and po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øibly
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:162405:99"/>he does not find the ≈øweetne≈øs, or the benefit of the mercy promi≈øed when the promi≈øe is fulfilled: Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he don't exerci≈øe faith in the promi≈øe it ≈øelf. When as the Lord gave Manna, <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> had the ≈øeetne≈øs of it, why? becau≈øe he exerci≈øed faith about it: But the children of I≈øra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, they make a tu≈øh of it, a light matter of it: why? becau≈øe they look't upon it in a way of ≈øence, &amp; did not take it in a way of beleeving, and ≈øo they lo≈øt the benefit, and ≈øweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the mercy promi≈øed. Beloved! it is no ≈ømall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, for to lo≈øe the benefit, and ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe of the mercy promi≈øed: that a Chri≈øtian lo≈øes by failing in his faith in regard of the Exerci≈øe of it; and therefore certainly it is a very evil thing: though their faith fail not in regard of the grace it ≈øelf, yet if it fail in regard of the work, and the exerci≈øe of it, it is a very evil thing, and much incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience comes unto the Saints thereby.</p>

                  </label> Satans great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign is, to hinder the work of Chri≈øt, the kingdom of Chri≈øt in the hearts of the Saint; to counter-work the Spirit of God. Satan does tempt that he may tempt: and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt temptation u≈øually comes in the reare, comes at the la≈øt. Satan does tempt a man to break the Law; but he hath a further reach in that: for he tempts a man to break the Law, that ≈øo he may tempt him afterwards to ≈øin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Go≈øpel: he lies in ambu≈øh in one temptation, for to draw to another. When Satan tempted our fir≈øt parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> he tempted like a ≈øerpent, in form of a ≈øerpent: and ≈øo now too, he comes, and he winds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us in his temptation; but his ≈øting is in the taile, and at the latter end. And thus ye ≈øee it was in the temptation of our Saviour Chri≈øt: his great de≈øign was upon Chri≈øts faith: in the 4. of <hi>mathhew,</hi> ye know he hath Three temptations there: and ≈øaies he, in the two fir≈øt temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>If thou be the Son of God?</hi> and <hi>If thou be the Son of God?</hi>

So 'tis with the Saints al≈øo: Satan, he comes and tempts them to ≈øowre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, frowardne≈ø≈øe, and pa≈ø≈øion in their families, but he hath a further reach upon that di≈øtemper: for (≈øaies he) I will tempt this man or woman to pa≈ø≈øion, and froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and when he hath been froward, and pa≈ø≈øionate, then I will tempt him to be doubting whether he be the child of God or no: fir≈øt I wil tempt this man for to break the Law, and when he hath broken the Law, then will Itempt him to ≈øin again≈øt the Go≈øpel, then will I ≈øtrike at his faith: his great de≈øign ≈øtill is upon your faith in all his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

Now faith is more precious than gold; the trial of your faith is, faith is the gift of God: and therefore, if he can get any thing from a man, he will get that which is Gods gift. He is the great hinderer of all good, of every good work; and he will e≈øpecially labour to hinder that work which is <hi>The</hi> work of God in a ≈øpecial manner: and this is THE <hi>Work of God, that ye beleeve in his Son.</hi> Satan knows, that faith is the mo≈øt Beneficial grace unto the Saints: The <hi>Shield</hi> of faith, it is called; and the <hi>Anchor</hi> of faith. If ye be in a ≈øtorm at ≈øea; faith is your Anchor: If ye be in danger at land, before Enemies, faith is your Shield. If that a mans Faith fail, his Duties fail, his heart failes, and all failes.

               <p>But above all things, remember that of the <hi>Commamnd to beleeve.

               <p>Sometimes Satan does labour to weaken the A≈ø≈øurance of the Saints, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> By telling them that they have no faith. A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance is the flower of faith, it grows upon faith; but you have no faith (≈øaies Satan) and therefore your a≈ø≈øurance is naught. But how unrea≈øonable is this temptation! for, ob≈øerve I pray, in what rounds Satan goes: He tempts us to beleeve that we have no faith, becau≈øe we have no A≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and he tempts us again, to beleeve we have no A≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, becau≈øe we have no faith. For an≈øwer hereunto, I ≈øhall only turn unto that 4. to the <hi>Romans:</hi> It is ≈øaid of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:162405:102"/>(at the 21. ver≈øe) Being fully per≈øwaded, that what God had promi≈øed, he was able al≈øo to perform. And therefore (at the 22.) it was imputed to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs. Now it was not written for his ≈øake alone, that it was imputed to him: but for us al≈øo to whom it ≈øhall be imputed, if we beleeve on him that rai≈øed up Je≈øus our Lord from the dead. <hi>Abraham</hi> was ju≈øtified by faith, it was imputed to him for righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe: and ≈øaies the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle here, it was not written for his ≈øake, but for us al≈øo. We are ju≈øti≈øied as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, by the ≈øame faith, what faith is that? is it the faith of A≈ø≈øurance? Yes! he was A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øured indeed, but I pray of what? He was A≈ø≈øured that God was able to performe: He being fully per≈øwaded, that what he had promi≈øed, he was able al≈øo to perform. <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved that God was able, and ≈øo relyed upon God, and hereby he was ju≈øtified. So it ≈øhall be with men and women now: if they be A≈ø≈øured, and Per≈øwaded, that God is able, and ≈øo relye upon God; this is the faith that ju≈øtifies. When therefore this temptation comes, An≈øwer unto Satan: Satan, thou ≈øaie≈øt I have no A≈ø≈øurance, becau≈øe I have no faith; but I have this A≈ø≈øurance that <hi>Abraham</hi> had, whereby he was ju≈øtified, I beleeve God is able to help me, and ≈øo I relye upon God, and therefore (Satan) I am now ju≈øtified, and ≈øtand righteous through Je≈øus Chri≈øt in the ≈øight of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As he does labour to weaken the faith of A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance, By telling the Saints that they have no faith: So al≈øo, by telling them, That they have no Obedience, that they don't profit under the means, that they are not fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: where ever there is true faith, there will be Obedienee, and men will profit under the means, and be fruitful; but you are Unfruitful, and you are barren, and where's your Obedience? here's no Obedience, therefore no faith: So no A≈ø≈øurance, your A≈ø≈øurance is wrong.</p>

                  </label> if this be true;
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:162405:103"/>That ye never were <hi>Obedient,</hi> never <hi>Fruitful,</hi> never <hi>profited by the means of grace;</hi> this blow fals dead upon the ≈øoul, this blow is not to be warded off, this is no temptation. But now, if ye have ever been fruitful, if ye have ever been obedient, if ye have ever profited by the means of grace; though for the pre≈øent ye may ≈øeem dead: yet remember what <hi>Job</hi> ≈øaies, <hi>There is hope of a tree, though it be cut down, that by the ≈øcent of waters it will flori≈øh again.</hi> And ≈øo, there is hope of thy ≈øoul, that by the ≈øcent of the <hi>Go≈øpel-waters</hi> thou maie≈øt flouri≈øh again. But though there be no obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in your own eye, though ye don't profit under the means in your own eye; yet your obedience may be in the eye of others: and in time of temptation, another mans eye is a better judge than your own.</p>
               <p>But ≈øuppo≈øe there ≈øeem to be no obedience, neither in your own, nor anothers eye; yet the root of the matter may be in you. Ye know how it is with the fi≈øh, that are in the water, in a windy and a ≈øtormy day: ye put many fi≈øh into a pond; and in a faire, ≈øun ≈øhiney day, ye ≈øee them playing upon the water, upon the uppermo≈øt part of the water; but in a rainy, and ≈øtormy day, ye ≈øee none of them there, but yet you ≈øay, they are all there, they are in the water, they are at the bottome, though you ≈øee them not. And ≈øo, it may be, in this ≈øtormy time of temptation, your obedience, and profiting is not ≈øeen, but it may be there as heretofore. Satan does never more pre≈ø≈øe a child of God, to try him≈øelf by ≈øigns of grace drawn from his own conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øation, than in the time of temptation. There is indeed a good u≈øe of ≈øigns drawn from our own conver≈øation, but this is agreed upon by all, That there's no u≈øe of them in the time of temptation. And therefore ≈øaies <hi>Luther: In the time of temptation, I am as if there were no Law, nor no works, but only the righteou≈øne≈øs of Chri≈øt in the world, and ≈øo I do re≈øt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him.</hi> Does Satan come forth therefore with this temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That you have no obedience, that you don't profit, that you are Unfruitful? An≈øwer it thus: True Satan, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øe I am very Unprofitable, and therefore I will learn to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:162405:103"/>profit more; I confe≈ø≈øe I am very unfruitful, and therefore I will labour to be more fruitful: But (Satan) I will not now at this time determine about my Condition; for it may be a time of temptation: hereafter, at another time, I will come and determine about my Condition, and I will look after ≈øignes; but now at this time, it may be a time of temptation, and therefore I will forbear to winde, and draw up a conclu≈øion, but leane my ≈øelf upon God, and re≈øt upon God at this time.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Sometimes Satan does labour to weaken the <hi>A≈ø≈øurance</hi> of Gods people, <hi>the faith of A≈ø≈øurance,</hi> to make that to fail, By telling of them, that they have no faith at all, becau≈øe they have no particular faith, no particular promi≈øe; for, ≈øaies Satan thus: faith and Wavering, faith and Doubting do not agree; He that beleeveth doubteth not: but now, you pray and doubt, you beleeve and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ye have no particular word for what you beleeve, therefore ye have no particular faith, ≈øo no faith at all, and therefore your A≈ø≈øurance is naught.</p>

               <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Tell thy ≈øoul this: That though God is plea≈øed thus to indulge, and ≈øometimes to give out a particular promi≈øe unto his people, and they have a particular faith concerning this or that bu≈øine≈ø≈øe; yet there is alwaies a Waiting-faith that we reade of in Scripture.

                  <hi>Either a particular Word and Promi≈øe does come unt ye, or it does not, in the time of your temptation.</hi> If it do come unto ye, Take heed that ye dont' mea≈øure your ≈øelves, or your condition, by the warmth, and life, and inlargment of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:162405:105"/>your heart which ye have at the coming in of the word. And if a particular word, or Scripture, and promi≈øe do not come unto you in the time of your temptation; don't mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure your ≈øelves, and your condition, by the ≈øtraightne≈øs, and deadne≈ø≈øe of your heart which you have at that time when a particular word does not come.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If temptaion come, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>3</label> 
                  <hi>Look much unto the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Je≈øus Chri≈øt:</hi> not the ≈øinful infirmities, for ≈øo he had none, but he had many other infirmities. And ye know what the Spou≈øe in the time of De≈øertion ≈øaies, in the book of the <hi>Canticles, His left hand is under my head, and with his right hand he does imbrace me.</hi> The right hand, is a hand of power; and the left hand, is a hand of weakne≈ø≈øe: and in the time of De≈øertion, and Temptation, it's a great relief to a poor ≈øoul, to con≈øider the infirmities of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, his left hand is under our head then. As when a man is inlarged in heart, 'tis good to con≈øider of Chri≈øts Example, that ≈øo he may be humbled under his inlargement: So when a man is in De≈øertion, or Temptation, it's good for to think of Chri≈øts Infirmities, that ≈øo he may not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, or ca≈øt down too much.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If temptation do come, be ≈øure of this, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>4</label> 
                  <hi>That ye don't conclude it is no temptation.</hi> Satan tempts, and then he tempts a man to think it is no temptation. So long as a poor ≈øoul thinks it is but a temptation, his heart is borne up with comfort, and he ≈øaies, It is but a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it will be over ≈øhortly, and the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt will pity me, for 'tis but a temptation, and ≈øo his heart is borne up with comfort, waiting upon God: But if the Devil can get a man ≈øo far, as to make him think it is no temptation, but wor≈øe than a temptation; then his heart fails, and his faith failes. Therefore, I be≈øeech ye, If a temptation come, don't conclude it is no temptation, but ≈øay, Oh! it may be 'tis a temptation, and therefore I will wait on God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If temptation come, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>5</label> 
                  <hi>Remember thine own ≈øoul of the waies of God with thee. Gods waies</hi> (ye know) <hi>are in the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:162405:106"/>deep, and his foot≈øteps are not known: but as the Heavens are greater than the earth, ≈øo are Gods waies of mercy beyond our waies.</hi> Now therefore, if a drak temptation do come upon ye, and ye ≈øee no way to get out, ≈øay, O but my ≈øoul, remember Gods waies are infinite, and his waies are beyond our waies; and though I ≈øee no way, God hath infinite waies, he walks over mulbery-trees, and his waies have been in the deep; and ≈øo it hath been all along with my ≈øoul, and therefore now, O my ≈øoul, wait on God.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>6</label> If temptation come, if Satan come, <hi>Do you run to Chri≈øt; and look how Satan appears to you, ≈øo do you apply the Attributes of Chri≈øt to you ≈øutable to his temptation.</hi> Does Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ≈øet a temptation unto your brea≈øt? ob≈øerve what temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it is, and take an Attribute of Chri≈øt ≈øutable to that temptation, and ≈øet it to the brea≈øt of that temptation. For Example: Does Satan come and tempt as <hi>a Serpent?</hi> Then remember, that Je≈øus Chri≈øt is the <hi>bra≈øen ≈øerpent.</hi> Does Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan come and pre≈øent him≈øelf as a <hi>roaring Lyon?</hi> Now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that Je≈øus Chri≈øt is the <hi>Lyon of the tribe of Judah.</hi> Does Satan come and pre≈øent him≈øelf as an <hi>Accu≈øer?</hi> Now remember, that the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt is <hi>an advocate.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved! in the time of temptation, ye are to run to Chri≈øt, that is true; but that is not all, but you are to ob≈øerve how your temptation lies, and apply that Attribute of Chri≈øt to your ≈øoul which is ≈øutable to your temptation: do this, and your faith ≈øhall not faile in time of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>7</label> and la≈øtly. <hi>Above all things, take the Shield of faith.</hi> Take the Shield of faith, that your faith may not fail: for, the way to beleeve is to beleeve; the way to pray is to pray; the way to hear, is to hear; the way to receive, is to receive; the way to perform duty, is to perform duty; the way to exerci≈øe grace, is to exerci≈øe grace. When temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation therefore does come upon thee, that thy faith may not fail, now ≈øtir up thy ≈øelf to this work of faith, and to beleeve; and if ye beleeve that ye ≈øhall overcome, ye ≈øhall overcome; and if ye beleeve that ye ≈øhall prevaile again≈øt
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:162405:106"/>your temptations, ye ≈øhall prevaile again≈øt your temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

Wherefore, ≈øtir up your ≈øelves now to beleeve when temptation comes. When ye have to deal with an Enemy here among men, I don't ≈øay, beleeve ye ≈øhall overcome your enemy, and ye ≈øhall overcome: a man may beleeve he ≈øhal overcome his outward enemy here in the field, and yet fall before him, and not overcome: but having to deal with this enemy, Gods enemy, your fathers enemy, and your enemy; beleeve ye ≈øhall overcome him, and ye ≈øhall overcome him.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He≈øe words (as ye have heard) acquaints us with a great temptation that was to come down upon Chri≈øts Di≈øciples.

               <p>Now that which is expre≈øt is; <hi>Chri≈øts tender care of, and love unto his Di≈øciples in regard of their temptations.</hi> And this love and care of his towards his Di≈øciples under temptation, is Expre≈øt in many things.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>1</label> Fir≈øt, <hi>In the ordering of their temptations.</hi> For there is no temptation befalls any of His, but he mea≈øures out the temptation according to their abilities. As a wi≈øe Phifitian, does not give the ≈øame Phy≈øick unto every per≈øon, but con≈øiders every ones ability; that which he gives to one, is too ≈øtrong for another: he con≈øiders fir≈øt the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his patient, and pre≈øcribes accordingly. Now, though our Saviour Chri≈øt don't direct Satan for to tempt, yet he does order him in tempting; and Satan cannot put
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:162405:108"/>the lea≈øt dram into any temptation, but as it is mea≈øured out by the hand of Chri≈øt. And this is that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle ≈øpeaks plainly, in the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. Chapter, and the 13. ver≈øe. <hi>But God is faithful who will not ≈øuffer you to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above that you are able &amp;c.</hi> that ye may be able to bear it.<note place="margin">P≈øal. <hi>139</hi>
                  </note> The P≈øalmi≈øt <hi>David ≈øaies,</hi> Search me, O Lord, and prove me. That is (≈øaies <hi>Gregory</hi>) Fir≈øt, O Lord, look upon, my ≈øtrength, and then, if I mu≈øt be tempted, ≈øuffer me to be tempted according to mine ability. Chri≈øt does mea≈øure out all the temptations of his people according to their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As he does mea≈øure out their temptations ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their abilities: <hi>So he does al≈øo, mortifie their temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and weaken them as they come through his hand.</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them before they do come at his Di≈øciples, and people, before they do come at you. And upon this account (partly) it is ≈øaid, <hi>That we are more than conquerers, through Chri≈øt that giveth victory.</hi> Becau≈øe our enemy is overcome before he ≈øtrikes, and his blow is broken as he ≈øtrikes. And therefore ≈øaies the Apo≈øtle, concerning our Saviour, <hi>That he hath ≈øpoil'd principalities, and powers, and made a ≈øhew of them openly upon the cro≈ø≈øe.</hi> All your temptations, the power and ≈øtrength of them were ≈øpoil'd upon the cro≈ø≈øe. There's no temptation befals any of Gods people, but it is mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and weakned before it does come it them, the ≈øting, teeth, and the poi≈øon being taken out.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He does not only thus mortifie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and weaken a temptation before it does come at us: <hi>But he does cau≈øe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ≈øo to lay his temptations, as that he may be di≈øcerned, and ≈øo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome,</hi> Satan tempted <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi> but he tempted in a ≈øerpent, and ≈øo <hi>Adam</hi> might ea≈øily have di≈øcerned the hand of Satan in it: for <hi>Adam</hi> knew all the creatures; he gave them their Names, &amp; he knew their Natures: and he knew well enough the ≈øerpent could not ≈øpeak to him; he might ea≈øily have known, that the hand of Satan was in the bu≈øine≈øs. And ≈øo now, though God does ≈øuffer Satan to tempt his people, yet he does cau≈øe Satan ≈øo to lay his
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:162405:109"/>temptations, as that the black feet of the tempter may be di≈øcovered: and when a temptation is di≈øcovered, 'tis half overcome.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> He doth not only thus: But the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, hath the <hi>Timeing</hi> of all our temptationps. Time is a great matter in the point of temptation. Should a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation come at ≈øuch or ≈øuch a time, po≈ø≈øibly Gods child might be overwhelmed. I prai≈øe the Lord (≈øaies one) I did re≈øi≈øt ≈øuch a temptation; but had it fallen out at ≈øuch a time, I ≈øhould never have been able to have ≈øtood under it. Satan ob≈øerves his tempting times: he knowes that great advantage may be made unto him by his time. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Chri≈øt was an hungry, he tempted him to turn ≈øtones into bread: ob≈øerved his time. And as Satan does ob≈øerve his time to tempt: So our Lord and Saviour Chri≈øt, does ≈øet him his time; &amp; the time of his temptations are in the hand of Chri≈øt. And therefore, if ye look into the 20. chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> the 1. 2. and 3. ver≈øes, ye ≈øhall find to this purpo≈øe thus: <hi>I ≈øaw an Angel come down from Heaven, having the key of the bottomle≈øs pit, and a great chain in his hand: And he laid hold on the dragon, the old ≈øerpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him a thou≈øand years, and ca≈øt him into the bottomle≈øs pit, and ≈øhut him up, and ≈øet a ≈øeal upon him, that he ≈øhould deceive the nations no more till the thou≈øand years ≈øhould be fulfilled, and after that, he mu≈øt be loo≈øed a little ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon.</hi> (Mark) The Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, hath not only the tempter in a chain, that he can go no further than he gives him leave to go; but his hand al≈øo, is in the hand of Chri≈øt, and Chri≈øt hath an eye to the Time of his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a ≈øpecial eye upon the time of our temptation, and this argues much of his care and love.</p>
               <p>Fiftly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> He hath not only the Timeing of our tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But he does al≈øo <hi>Sanctifie</hi> our temptations, and does make them ble≈ø≈øed means of <hi>our Sanctification.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øaies <hi>Paul, I received the me≈ø≈øenger Satan for to buffet me, that I might not be exalted.</hi> Twice he hath that, That he might not be <hi>exalted</hi> out of mea≈øure. But for this I need go
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:162405:109"/>no further than the in≈øtance of <hi>Peter;</hi> before <hi>Peter</hi> was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; what abundance of carnal confidence was there in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi> Lord (≈øaies he) <hi>though all men for ≈øake thee, yet will not I.</hi> But now, I pray look upon him after his temptation, and you ≈øhall ≈øee how this carnall confidence was laid down: for, our Saviour ≈øaies unto him, <hi>Peter, love≈øt thou me more than the≈øe? Lord</hi> (≈øaies he) <hi>thou knowe≈øt I love thee:</hi> but not a word of the comparative, <hi>More than the≈øe,</hi> he had left comparing now, having been under temptation, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fallen, his carnal confidence was gone; and he don't ≈øay now, Lord, though all men for≈øake thee, yet will not I: the compari≈øon is left out now: he an≈øwers to the other part, but not a word to that. So that I ≈øay, If the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt do mea≈øure out all our temptation for us: And mortifie them before they come at us: And does cau≈øe Satan to lay them, as we may mo≈øt ea≈øily di≈øcover them: And if the Lord Chri≈øt does Time our temptations for us: And ≈øanctifie them unto us: Then certainly, there is much of Oh ri≈øts love and mercy at work for his people under their temptations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If you ask me yet further, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Que≈øt. </seg>2</label> 
                  <hi>Wherein is the love of Chri≈øt expre≈øt, or drawn out unto his people under their temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi>

                  <hi>in, and by their temptations.</hi> Tempting times, are teaching times unto Gods people: the ≈øchool of temptation is a great ≈øchool. <hi>Luther</hi> ≈øaid, that the temptations of Satan, were the imbracings of Chri≈øt: meaning, that then Chri≈øt did imbrace his people mo≈øt, and di≈øcover mo≈øt of his love unto them. Three things (he ≈øaid) there were that made a Preacher: <hi>Meditation, Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Temptation.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when, or where does God or Chri≈øt reveal him≈øelfe more fully unto his people, than in the times of their temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations? 'Tis ≈øaid, that at <hi>Ma≈ø≈øab</hi> and <hi>Meribah,</hi> the waters of ≈øtrife and of temptation, there the Lord gave I≈ørael his ≈øtatutes. How many experiences do Gods people get, in, and by their temptations? tempting times are teaching:

               <p>Yea, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, He does not only teach his people; But he does al≈øo <hi>bear up, and uphold their hearts with new ≈øupplies of his grace, and Spirit, in the times of their temptations.</hi> Chri≈øt does not ≈øuffer his people to go into new temptations, with old ≈øtrength: but as a new temptation does come from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, ≈øo new ≈øupply of grace and ≈øtrength does come from Chri≈øt. Saies <hi>David,</hi> in the 94. <hi>P≈øalm,</hi> and the 18. ver≈øe. <hi>When I ≈øaid, my foot ≈ølippeth: thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.</hi> He does not ≈øay thus: when my foot ≈ølippeth; thy mercy, O Lord held me up: but when <hi>I ≈øaid, my foot ≈ølippeth;</hi> when I thought I was quite <hi>rejected,</hi> ca≈øt off, and for≈øaken: when I ≈øaid, my foot ≈ølippeth: then thy mercy, O Lord, held me up. As new temptations do come in, ≈øo new ≈øtrength comes in.</p>
               <p>Yea, and ≈øupplies of greace in Proportion to our tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>My grace is ≈øufficient for thee</hi> (≈øaies the Lord to <hi>Paul</hi>) my grace is Fit for thee.</p>
               <p>Yea, he does not only give out Proportionable ≈øtrength; but an <hi>Cverplus of ≈øirength.</hi> As the woman, that had oyle given her, not enough barely to pay her debt, but an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verplus to live on the re≈øt. So Gods people in the time of their temptations, have not only ≈øtrength given them to ≈øtand out again≈øt their temptations, but an Cverplus to live on the re≈øt.</p>
               <p>Yea, and they have not only in-comes of A≈ø≈øi≈øting grace; but of <hi>Accepting grace too;</hi> more Accepting grace. God doth and will then Accept le≈ø≈øer than at another time. Though the prayer be weak, and the faith low; yet, ≈øaies the Lord, it is the time of temptation with this my poor ≈øervant; and therefore I will take the Duty, though it be never ≈øo little, becau≈øe it is the time of temptation, it's a time of darkne≈øs, and a time of ≈øadne≈øs. Ye know what our ≈øaviour ≈øaid unto <hi>Thomas: Reach hither thine hand, and put it into my ≈øide:</hi> Come <hi>Thomas,</hi> if thou wilt not beleeve without it, I'le take thy faith, even upon the≈øe termes, for
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:162405:110"/>I know it is a time of temptation with thee. What grace! what love and mercy is here!</p>
               <p>Yea, Fourthly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt does not only come in thus, with ≈øupplies of grace, &amp; ≈øtrength in the times of temptation: But he does give his people an <hi>Ea≈øe,</hi> and a <hi>Remedy, a breathing time under their temptations, though they be never ≈øo ≈øad, and never ≈øo great.</hi> Indeed, <hi>Job</hi> ≈øaid, That God was his enemy, and would not ≈øuffer him to <hi>≈øwallow his ≈øpittle,</hi> he followed him ≈øo clo≈øe: but the good man was mi≈øtaken much: for at the ≈øame time, the time of his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he could ≈øay, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth;</hi> and he could ble≈ø≈øe the Lord: he had his breathing time in the mid≈øt of all. When <hi>David</hi> was per≈øecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> he was under temptation, for, as the Devil ca≈øts ≈øome men into pri≈øon; ≈øo the Devil per≈øecutes in wicked men: yet <hi>David</hi> had his breathing time, now and then, <hi>Saul</hi> given into his hands, as a pledge of that ful deliverance that <hi>David</hi> ≈øhould have afterwards. And this is no other than that which the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks of, in that ≈øame 1 of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the 10. Chap. at the 13. ver≈øe, <hi>Who will not ≈øuffer you to be tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that you are able; but will with the temptation al≈øo, make a way to e≈øcape.</hi> Make an <hi>Out-let,</hi> (≈øo the word is;) He will make an Out-let. Though the ≈ømoke be very offen≈øive, yet there ≈øhall alwaies be ≈øome window open for to let it out, or ≈øome door open for a poor tempted ≈øoul to go out at: ≈øtil an out-let, ≈øome breathing time in the mid≈øt of the≈øe temptations.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, and la≈øtly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> As the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt liveth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to make interce≈ø≈øion for us; <hi>So he doth it e≈øpecially when his people are under temptation; then he prayes for them, and then e≈øpecially.</hi> I will not determine, whether Chri≈øt now in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven does intercede Vocally, or Really: but when Satan lies hard upon a poor tempted ≈øoul, and fetches blood from it, then does the Lord Je≈øus ≈øtep in unto his Father, and pre≈øent his wounds, and his blood, and ≈øaies unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, O Father, I have prayed unto thee, that this poor man or woman, may not fail in the time of temptation.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:162405:111"/>Thus it was with <hi>Peter</hi> here; I have prayed for thee: and yet this was not the time of his full interce≈ø≈øion, when he was here on earth. There are two parts of Chri≈øts Prie≈øtly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and <hi>Interce≈ø≈øion.</hi> The proper place for him to make <hi>≈øatisfaction for ≈øin,</hi> was here on earth: and in Heaven, the holy of holie≈øt, he does make <hi>interce≈ø≈øion;</hi> there he does do it fully, but he could not for bear while he was here on earth, but he ≈øaies unto <hi>Peter, I have prayed for thee.</hi> Though my great work in Heaven be to intercede, and my ≈øpecial work here on earth be to ≈øatisfie: yet notwith≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I have prayed for thee already <hi>Peter.</hi> And the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt was heard in all that he prayed for. Now then, if the Lord Chri≈øt doth intercede here on earth for his poor tempted ≈øervants, and was heard here; how much more, when his Di≈øciples are tempted, does he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, and pray for them in Heaven, and is heard there. Satan may come running in upon you with his temptation: but when Satan runs in upon you with his temptation, Chri≈øt runs into the pre≈øence of God the Father, and ≈øpreads his blood, and his ≈øatisfaction for you, and there he ≈øaies unto the Father, Father, I have prayed that this man or womans faith may not fail. Oh! what grace and mercy, and love is here! Thus, in all the≈øe re≈øpects, (and many others that I might mention) is the love of Chri≈øt, and his mercy drawn out unto his people in the time of their temptation.</p>

                  <hi>But how may it appear, that Chri≈øts mercy is mo≈øt at work, when his people are mo≈øt a≈ø≈øaulted by Satan?</hi> Chri≈øt deals by His, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>
                  </label> as God the Father did deal by Him. Now ye ≈øhall find, that Gods love was never more towards Chri≈øt, than when Chri≈øt was under temptation. When Chri≈øt came to die, Satan was very bu≈øie; it's called, <hi>The hour of darkne≈øs:</hi> ≈øo bu≈øie was Satan with all his malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him; yet then was the Fathers love towards Chri≈øt, then e≈øpecially; for ≈øaies Chri≈øt, <hi>Therefore does the Father love me, becau≈øe I lay down my life.</hi> If the Father did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore love him, becau≈øe he laid down his life, then his love
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:162405:111"/>was mo≈øt at work towards Chri≈øt when this hour of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs was. And ≈øo I ≈øay, when you hour of darkne≈øe is, the hour of temptation; Chri≈øts love is then mo≈øt at work becau≈øe he deals by His, as the Father did deal by Him.</p>
               <p>The truth is, Chri≈øts dealing with his Di≈øciples, was a pattern and plat-form of his dealing with all his people, to the end of the world. Now ye ≈øhall ob≈øerve, that Chri≈øts love was never more let out towards his Di≈øciples, than from this time, after he had ≈øaid the≈øe words, <hi>Satan hath de≈øired to ≈øift you as wheat.</hi> After this time they were all offended becau≈øe of Chri≈øt, and they all for≈øook him: <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> denied him; ≈øome doubted whether he were the Me≈ø≈øiah or no: and another would not beleeve his Re≈øurrection; &amp; as ≈øheep, they were all ≈øcattered, and ≈øhattered; great was their temptations: yet from this time, do but ob≈øerve the love of Chri≈øt towards them: after this ≈øpeech, then Chri≈øt preaches a mo≈øt excellent, and ≈øweet Sermon to them, in the 14, 15, and 16. chapters of <hi>John.</hi> Then he takes wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and a towel, and wa≈øhes and wipes his Di≈øciples feet. Then he appoints the Lords Supper. Then he ≈øpends a whol chapter (the 17. of <hi>John</hi>) in prayer for them, makes a mo≈øt excellent, and ≈øweet prayer for them. Then he cals them his friends: <hi>Ye are no longer my ≈øervants, but my friends:</hi> Yea, <hi>his Children:</hi> Yea, his <hi>Little children.</hi> Never was his love more drawn out, or expre≈øt towards them, than after this time. And (I ≈øay) this was a pattern, and a plat-form of his dealing with all his people unto the end of the world. And therefore, though Chri≈øt do ≈øuffer his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be tempted, yet his love and mercy is never more at work than when they are mo≈øt a≈ø≈øaulted by Satan.</p>

                  <hi>What is there in the heart of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, that does incline him to this indulgence toward his people, that his love and mercy is then mo≈øt at work when they are mo≈øt a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaulted by Satan?</hi>

                  </label> There is the <hi>quinte≈øcence</hi> of all the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of loving relations in Je≈øus Chri≈øt. A Father, a Mother, a Brother, a Friend; He is the <hi>everla≈øting Father. And his

And ≈øo, though Chri≈øt be alwaies tender of his people, yet then e≈øpecially, when their ≈øouls are ≈øick; and labour under temptation. There is the greate≈øt pity in Chri≈øt that can be, the mo≈øt pitiful di≈øpo≈øition in Chri≈øt; which is alwaies laid out where he ≈øees a fit object for it: pray what is the object of pity? The object of pity is, One whom ye love in mi≈øery. If ye ≈øee a man in mi≈øery, yet if ye don't love him, ye don't pity him; if ye ≈øee a man whom ye love, yet if ye don't ≈øee him in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øery, ye don't pity him, ye love him, but ye don't pity him: but a per≈øon whom ye love in mi≈øery, is the object of pity. Now all the Saints and people of God, are the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of Chri≈øt; and when they are in temptation, that is their greate≈øt mi≈øery; and therefore, when they are mo≈øt tempted, then is the love and mercy of Chri≈øt drawn out unto them e≈øpecially.</p>
               <p>Be≈øides, The Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt hath a great Intere≈øt, and ≈øhare in every beleever, a ≈øhare going in every beleever. As the member hath an intere≈øt and a ≈øhare in the head; ≈øo the head hath al≈øo in every member. <hi>Thine they were</hi> (≈øaies Chri≈øt) <hi>and thou gave≈øt them me.</hi> Chri≈øt hath a ≈øpecial and great intere≈øt in all his people, and he will not lo≈øe his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt. The truth is, when Satan does a≈ø≈øault a beleever, he does rather ≈øtrike at Chri≈øt, than at a beleever. And therefore ≈øaies <hi>Gregory</hi> well, The Devil in tempting <hi>Job,</hi> did not ≈øo much ≈øtrike at <hi>Job,</hi> as at God; for the Lord had ≈øaid, That <hi>Job</hi> was an upright man: and now the Devil would go about to make <hi>Job</hi> an Hypocrite; ≈øo that the Devill would fain have made God a lyar; and he did not ≈øo much ≈øtrike at <hi>Job,</hi> as at Gods te≈øtimony of <hi>Job,</hi> he did ≈øtrike at God. And ≈øo now in all the temptations of the Saints, he ≈øtrikes at <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> and they bear tho≈øe temptations becau≈øe of Chri≈øt. Let a man go on in a wicked, and ungodly way,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:162405:112"/>Satan won't vex him with temptations; but let a man once become godly, and be in Chri≈øt, and then, how many temptations will Satan vex him with? Now (≈øaies Chri≈øt) ≈øhall this poor ≈øoul endure all this for me? and ≈øhall not I help? ≈øhall not I a≈ø≈øi≈øt? ≈øhall not I deliver? If a man break his Arme, or his Leg before ye, you will pity him: but if he break his Arme, or his leg in your work, or ≈øervice, in a work that you ≈øet him about, you count your ≈øelf ingaged then to help him. 'Tis the work of Chri≈øt that the Saints are about, and Chri≈øt ≈øets them on work, and when Satan comes to tempt, 'tis to di≈øturbe them in the work that Chri≈øt ≈øets them about: Now therefore, (≈øaies Chri≈øt) ≈øhall they endure all this becau≈øe of me, and becau≈øe of my work? and ≈øhall not I a≈ø≈øi≈øt, and defend them, and help them? Surely I will. Oh! my beloved, if ye did but know what an Intere≈øt Je≈øus Chri≈øt hath in every beleever, you would ea≈øily ≈øee the rea≈øon of this, ≈øo great tenderne≈øs in him, that his love and mercy is never more at work, than when they are mo≈øt a≈ø≈øaulted by Satan.</p>

See what he ≈øaies; his faith ≈øtands notwith≈øtanding this; <hi>But God is the ≈øtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever:</hi> here's his faith. So that though his fle≈øh failed, and his heart failed; yet his faith did not fail. There is a great deal of difference between a recoyling fit of a heart-failing in time of temptation, and the failing of ones faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>It is one thing for you to fail in your faith in our own opinion; and another thing for your faith to fail in the opinion of Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> When <hi>Peter</hi> denied his Lord and Ma≈øter, in his own opinion he could not but think that his faith failed; and yet in the opinion of Je≈øus Chri≈øt his faith did not fail; for Chri≈øt prayed that his faith ≈øhould not fail, and it did not fail, for Chri≈øt was heard in what he prayed for.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>There is great deal of difference, between the failing of faith, and failings that do accompany faith.</hi> The poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that came to Chri≈øt, and touched the hem of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, failed very much, for ≈øhee came behinde him and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:162405:114"/>thought to have ≈øtolen a cure: I but, though there were many failings that did accompany her faith, yet her faith did not fail; for ≈øhe came and touched the hem of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and was cured by her faith. So I ≈øay, there is a great deal of difference between the failing of faith, and the failings that do accompany faith: there may be many fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings that do accompany ones faith, and yet ones faith may ≈øtand, and not fail.</p>
               <p>But yet further, Who≈øoever you are, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that ≈øay your faith fails you, and therefore you are afraid that Chri≈øt prayes not for you: Man or woman, Did thy faith ever fail thee like <hi>Peters;</hi> did≈øt thou ever deny thy Lord and Ma≈øter as <hi>Peter</hi> did? and yet Chri≈øt ≈øaid, <hi>I have prayed that thy faith fail not,</hi> and he was heard in the thing that he prayed for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oh! but, that was but one Act in</hi> Peter; <label type="milestone">

                  </label> 
                  <hi>but my faith doth con≈øtantly fail;</hi> Peter <hi>denied, and his faith failed in the exerci≈øe as to one Act, but my faith doth con≈øtantly fail in time of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I was heretofore more able to beleeve in the time of my temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation than now I am; my faith is failed, and it con≈øtantly fails, and therefore I fear that the Lord Chri≈øt will not pray for me in the time of my temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, <hi>But if you be more able to relye upon meer free-grace,</hi>

                  <hi>than ye have been heretofore, then your faith is not le≈øs, but increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed rather.</hi> If you be now more able to be contented with your condition, than you were heretofore. If you can let God and Chri≈øt alone, to u≈øe his own means about you. If you can leave the Events and ≈øucce≈ø≈øes of things, more unto God than you could heretofore; then your faith is not failed, but rather increa≈øed.

                  </label> I mu≈øt yet ≈øay again to you: <hi>Ha≈øt thou ≈øinned more than this</hi> Peter <hi>did, when he denied his Lord and Ma≈øter?</hi> Yet Chri≈øt prayed for him, and his prayer took and prevailed.

And yet if you look into the 1. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> you ≈øhall find, that Chri≈øt after his Re≈øurrection, bids his Di≈øciples for to ≈øtay and wait at Jeru≈øalem, and not ≈øtir from thence; and preach the Go≈øpel, and mercy, and free-grace in Jeru≈øalem. Ha≈øt thou (man or woman, that make≈øt this objection) ≈øinned more than tho≈øe that did put Chri≈øt to death? that run him into his body with a ≈øpear? that nailed him upon the cro≈ø≈øe? ha≈øt thou ≈øinned more than the≈øe? Ye know our Lord and Saviour when he was upon the cro≈ø≈øe, he prayed for them; Oh! <hi>Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, they know not what they do.</hi> But, (Lord) the≈øe are thine oppo≈øers, the≈øe are per≈øecutors, and they per≈øecute thee to death. Well, be it ≈øo, (≈øaies Chri≈øt) I know what I do, and I know whom I pray for: Father forgive them, they know not what they do. Oh! what grace, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and love is here! Comfort, yea, Comfort unto all the Di≈øciples of Je≈øus Chri≈øt: when ye are in temptation, the Lord Chri≈øt is at prayer for you. And remember the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; Never is his love and mercy more at work for ye, than when Satan is mo≈øt bu≈øie about ye, to tempt ye mo≈øt. What comfort is here! This was that (in part) that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted the Martyrs in the Primitive times, ye reade of very great comforts that the Martyrs had in the Primitive times, tho≈øe times next after Chri≈øt: I have de≈øired to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider, what it was e≈øpecially, that bore up their hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all tho≈øe per≈øecutions. And <hi>Turtullian,</hi> pitches upon this as one thing: We con≈øider (≈øaies he) the ca≈øe of <hi>Peter;</hi>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:162405:115"/>Satan de≈øired to winnow him; Chri≈øt prayed for him. Here were (≈øaies <hi>Turtullian</hi>) two reque≈øts before God the Father: One was the reque≈øt of Satan: and another was the reque≈øt of Chri≈øt. Now the Son having more credit with God the Father than Satan, his reque≈øt mu≈øt needs prevail: So (≈øaies he) Satan hath de≈øired for to tempt, and to winnow us, and per≈øecute us; but the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt hath reque≈øted for us: There are two reque≈øts before God the Father; There's Satans reque≈øt to winnow us; and there's the Sons reque≈øt praying for us: Now therefore, ≈øeeing that the Son hath more credit with God the Father than Satan, therefore are we a≈ø≈øured that we ≈øhall be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, and our faith ≈øhall not fail. And ≈øo may you al≈øo. This is matter of great comfort unto all the Saints.</p>
               <p>You will ≈øay, <hi>Indeed it is matter of great comfort:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Much every way.</hi> If I be an Ungodly man; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>
                  </label> what a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty incouragement is here for to get into Je≈øus Chri≈øt, that I may be in the number of the true Di≈øciples. So long as a man is out of Chri≈øt, not a true Di≈øciple of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; Satan may come and tempt, and do what he wil with him, and no Chri≈øt by to help. Satan could not hurt, or touch, or tempt <hi>Job,</hi> but he mu≈øt ask leave: But Satan went to the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> and brought in them upon <hi>Jobs</hi> E≈øtate, and he did not ask leave for that, they were in his power: <hi>He ruleth in the children of di≈øobedience. Daniel</hi> was in the Lyons-den, and they devouered him not, their mouthes were ≈øtopt, and they could not hurt him: But when the Enemies were thrown into the Lyons, they crack'd, and cru≈øh'd their bones before they came to the ground. If a godly man, one that is a true Di≈øciple of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, if he be in a den with the≈øe Lyons, Devils, their mouths ≈øhall be ≈øtopt, they ≈øhall not ≈øwallow him. But oh! for wicked men, that are not in Chri≈øt, the≈øe Lyons, they cru≈øh their bones, every day they cru≈øh their bones: and a wicked man may ≈øay as <hi>Saul</hi> did, <hi>The Phili≈øtims are upon me, and God is departed from me:</hi>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:162405:116"/>So a wicked man, that is not in Chri≈øt, he may cry out and ≈øay, Oh! temptations are upon me, and Chri≈øt is departed from me, I have none of Chri≈øt to help me: as for the Saints, and tho≈øe that are true Di≈øciples of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, they have Chri≈øt at hand, though they fall, Chri≈øt is by for to help them up. And Chri≈øt him≈øelf mea≈øures out all their temptations, and Chri≈øt a≈ø≈øi≈øts them, and helps them, but Oh! as for me, I am all alone in my temptations, I poor ≈øoul, am all alone in my temptations: Ah! who would be a Drunkard ≈øtill? who would be a Swearer ≈øtill? who would be an Unclean wanton ≈øtill? who would be a lyar, and a Theevi≈øh ≈øervant ≈øtill? Let me tell ye, that while ye go on in the≈øe ≈øins, you are out of Chri≈øt: Poor ≈øoul, a Swearer, a Drunkard, a common Lyar, a Sabbath-breaker, a Wanton, out of Chri≈øt, and thy temptations fall heavily upon thee; the Lord knowes, thou art all alone in the time of thy temptations: Oh! but, get into Je≈øus Chri≈øt, get into Je≈øus Chri≈øt, to be in the number of Chri≈øts true Di≈øciples; and when thou art tempted, the Lord prayes for thee; yea, and the love and mercy of Chri≈øt is never more at work for thee, than when thou art mo≈øt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and a≈ø≈øaulted by Satan. What a mighty incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is here to al that hear the word of the Lord, to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Je≈øus Chri≈øt!</p>
               <p>But if I be godly; and al this be true: Why ≈øhould I que≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion the love of God towards me in the time of my temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Beloved! ye know it in your Experience, ye are never more apt for to que≈øtion the love of Chri≈øt, than in tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and yet Chri≈øts love is never more at work for you, than in temptation. Oh! what an unworthy an≈øwering of Chri≈øts love is here!</p>
               <p>Again, If I be Godly: Why ≈øhould I not be contented, and quiet under all my temptations, though they be never ≈øo great? Chri≈øt prayeth for me, Chri≈øts love is mo≈øt at work now I am mo≈øt a≈ø≈øaulted, his bowels then yern to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me.</p>
               <p>Yea, If I be Godly: Why ≈øhould I not with <hi>Paul</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:162405:116"/>over all temptations? and make my boa≈øt of Chri≈øt, and ≈øay as he did, <hi>Now know I, that nothing ≈øhall ≈øeparate me from the love of God in Chri≈øt;</hi> not Principalities, nor Powers nor Devils, nor Temptations; for when I am mo≈øt tempted Chri≈øt is mo≈øt at work in love for me.</p>
               <p>Yea, (beloved in the Lord) why ≈øhould we not all warm our hearts with this love of Je≈øus Chri≈øt? it's a mercy that the Lord Chri≈øt will ca≈øt but an eye, or a look upon a poor ≈øoul under temptation; that is a mercy: I but, I tell ye more than ≈øo; Chri≈øt does not only ca≈øt an eye, and a look upon a poor tempted ≈øoul, but his love and mercy is never more at work, than when you are mo≈øt a≈ø≈øaulted, and tempted by Satan: Ah, what grace, and heart-warming love is here!</p>
               <p>If I be Godly: (again) upon this account, why ≈øhould I give over ≈øo ≈øoon, and lay down my weapon in time of temptation? If a City be beleaguer'd, be≈øieged, and know that help will come, they will not give over. And though I am thus be≈øieged, and thus tempted, help will certainly come, for Chri≈øt hath prayed; why ≈øhould I give over then in time of temptation?</p>
               <p>And if the≈øe things be ≈øo, if there be ≈øo much love in the heart of Chri≈øt towards poor tempted ≈øouls: then (belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) ≈øhould we not all run to Chri≈øt in the time, and hour of our temptation, run unto him by prayer?</p>
               <p>It may be there are ≈øome that will ≈øay, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Que≈øt. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>If Chri≈øt pray for us in time of temptation, what need we pray?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I pray look into this chapter, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>
                  </label> and you will find our Saviour carries it otherwi≈øe. In the text, ≈øaies he, <hi>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fall not.</hi> At the 46. ver≈øe, <hi>Why ≈øleep ye?</hi> (≈øaies he) <hi>ri≈øe and pray, le≈øt ye enter into temptation.</hi> So that, though he had ≈øaid, That he prayed for them, yet he cals upon them al≈øo to pray. It's good praying (my beloved) when mercy is coming: and mercy is then coming when Chri≈øt is praying; and when you are mo≈øt tempted, then Chri≈øt is at prayer.</p>
               <p>But to end all. What ever your temptations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:162405:117"/>be, you that are the ≈øervants of God, ≈øtill think ye hear Chri≈øt ≈øaying to ye, Man, Woman, be of good comfort, I have prayed for you: though thy temptations be very great, I have prayed for thee: thought thou can≈øt not pray for thy ≈øelf as thou would≈øt, I have prayed for thee: when fle≈øh fails, and eyes fail, and heart fails, and all fails, yet remember this, Chri≈øt prayeth for you, in the time of your temptation Chri≈øt prayeth for you: think that ye hear Chri≈øt ≈øpeaking to ye in the time of your temptation, for certainly he does it as well to his Di≈øciples now as he did to his Di≈øciples then, he does ≈øpeak and ≈øay, Be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, man or woman, though thy temptations be great, yet I have prayed for thee, and thy faith ≈øhall not fail.</p>

               <p>La≈øtly, What a man would not lo≈øe for all the world, that, you will ≈øay, is worthy of Prai≈øe, and Thankfulne≈øs.

By Temptation God u≈øes to keep men humble. The Hebrew word for <hi>Lees,</hi> the Lees of wine; comes from the root, that ≈øignifies to <hi>Keep,</hi> becau≈øe the wines are kept by the Lees. And ≈øo God is plea≈øed to keep men humble by the≈øe Temptations, in the≈øe Lees, and in the≈øe dregs God keeps mens graces. Temptations do you no hurt til ye yeeld to them. The greater the Temptation, and the more your fle≈øh does tremble at it; the greater the Affliction, but the le≈ø≈øer the Sin. Temptation is the ≈øouls Rape: it may deflowre your ≈øoul, offer violence to your ≈øoul; it cannot take away your innocency. Now, it it not a great mercy to be kept innocent, and cha≈øt unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt? <hi>Au≈øtin</hi> hath a notable ≈øpeech. <hi>If ye prai≈øe God under good things, ye are paid your debt: if ye prai≈øe God under evil, ye have made God your debter.</hi> The truth is, we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pay our debt to God, neither are we able to make God our debtor; but God is plea≈øed to call him≈øelf ≈øo: when men prai≈øe him under Temptations, and under Per≈øecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and under De≈øertions; God is plea≈øed to call him≈øelf <hi>our Debtor.</hi> Surely therefore, it is good for a Chri≈øtian to ble≈ø≈øe God, and to prai≈øe God in every thing, in all things to be thankful: in Affliction, in Per≈øecution, in De≈øertion, under Temptation: <hi>This is the will of God our Father, that we ≈øhould be thankful to him in every thing, in every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

               <p>Pe≈øides, Is it not worth our Thankfulne≈øs, that we have had ≈øo many daies of Thank≈øgiving together?

So then, Notwith≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all this; yet you are to be thankful: Thankful even in this condition, though many Errours yet ye are to be thankful, to be in all things thankful, in every thing thankful.

Thankful when ye are Afflicted, as well as when ye are Delivered. Thankful when ye have no Victories, as well as when ye have Victories. Some, it may be, now will Prai≈øe the Lord

               <p>Give me leave to propound ≈øome few Incouragments hereunto: for it ≈øeems a hard thing to be Thankful in every thing, in every condition.</p>
               <p>If you can be thankful in every thing; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> even when ye are low: you will engage God for to rai≈øe you up: If when you are weak; you engage God for to make you ≈øtrong: If when you are De≈øerted; you engage God to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large you, to ≈øhine upon you. It plea≈øes God much, you cannot plea≈øe him more, than to be Thankful in every thing, even when ye are low. For Example. Suppo≈øe a man be convinc'd of ≈øin, troubled in Con≈øcience, hath no a≈ø≈øurance of Gods love in Chri≈øt: If he ≈øhould die, he does not know whether he ≈øhould go to heaven, or hell. Yet notwith≈øtanding (≈øaies he) what ever become of me, I ble≈øs the Lord that I am come hither: I was going on in the mo≈øt ≈øad condition: the Lord hath opened my eyes, I ≈øee indeed nothing but the wrath of God, due for my ≈øins: but yet ble≈ø≈øed be the Lord, that hath opened my eyes to ≈øee this: I, (≈øaies the Lord) doe≈øt thou ble≈ø≈øe me becau≈øe I have opened thy eyes for to ≈øee thy ≈øins? I'le open thine eyes for to ≈øee thy Saviour. Doe≈øt thou ble≈ø≈øe me, becau≈øe I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened thy eyes to ≈øee thy own heart, and the naughtine≈øs thereof? I'le open thy eyes to ≈øee all my grace, and I'le cau≈øe all my grace to pa≈ø≈øe before thee. This engages God, when ye can be thankful for every thing, and when ye are low: it engages God much unto you.</p>
               <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Hereby your Afflictions ≈øhall be made ble≈ø≈øings unto you. You ≈øay, How ≈øhal I know whether an Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be a ble≈ø≈øing or no? Take this note: when thou can≈øt ble≈ø≈øe God under an Affliction, then thy Affliction is made a ble≈ø≈øing: thy very ble≈ø≈øing of God under an Affliction, makes thy Affliction a ble≈ø≈øing to thee. <hi>Job,</hi> greatly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:162405:125"/>and he ble≈øt God, and his Affliction was a ble≈ø≈øing to him: ≈øo ≈øhall it be with you. Touch but thy Affliction with a Thankful heart, it will turn it into gold.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The more you can be Thankful for any thing, when ye are low; the more peace ≈øhall your heart, and your ≈øoul be fild with.

               <p>To this purpo≈øe con≈øider the 4. to the <hi>Philippians:</hi> ≈øaies the Apo≈øtle: <hi>Be ye in nothing careful</hi> (at the 6. ver≈øe) <hi>but in every thing, by prayer, and ≈øupplication, with thanksgiving; let your reque≈øts be made known unto God. And the peace of God which pa≈ø≈øeth all under≈øtanding ≈øhall keep your hearts and minds through Chri≈øt Je≈øus.</hi> This is the way to get a great, and a full peace: Be in nothing careful: be in all things Thankful, then the peace of God ≈øhall guard you.</p>

               <p>La≈øtly, Be ≈øure of this, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that you maintain the ≈øen≈øe of your own unworthine≈øs. No man more Thankful than <hi>David;</hi> no man more ≈øen≈øible of his unworthine≈øs than <hi>David:</hi> Continually thankful; Continually ≈øen≈øible of his unworthines. There is a Two-fold unworthines: <hi>Creature</hi>-unworthine≈øs: and <hi>Sinful</hi>-unworthine≈øs. Accordingly a Two-fold ≈øence of unworthine≈øs: One that ari≈øes from the apprehen≈øion of creature-unworthines, of the emptines that is in us as Creatures: And another that ari≈øes from ≈øen≈øe of guilt of ≈øin. See them both in the 8. <hi>P≈øalm:</hi> The P≈øalmi≈øt there prai≈øes the Lord: <hi>O Lord our God,</hi> (ver≈øe the 1.) <hi>how excellent is thy Name in all the Earth! when I con≈øider the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the work of thy fingers, what is man that thou art mindful of him? and the Son of man that thou vi≈øite≈øt him.</hi> He prai≈øes the Lord, this Thankfulne≈øs was rai≈øed from the ≈øen≈øe of unworthine≈øs, it was Creature-unworthine≈øs: <hi>Lord, what is man? O Lord our God, how excellent is thy Name in all the earth! Lord, what is man?</hi> Look into the 116. <hi>P≈øalm:</hi> and there ye find the P≈øalmi≈øt prai≈øing God upon the ≈øence of unworthine≈øs too: <hi>Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; yea,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:162405:127"/>our God is merciful.</hi> (ver≈øe the 12.) <hi>What ≈øhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits towards me?</hi> here's his Thankfulne≈øs; it was rai≈øed upon ≈øence of unworthine≈øs: But what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthine≈øs? Sinful unworthine≈øs: (ver≈øe the 11.) <hi>I ≈øaid in my ha≈øt; all men are lyars: what ≈øhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits towards me?</hi> He was ≈øen≈øible of his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthine≈øs, and it was a ≈øinful unworthine≈øs: <hi>I ≈øaid in my ha≈øt; all men are lyars:</hi> yet God is gracious to me, <hi>What ≈øhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits?</hi> So now it will be with you: if ye can but keep the ≈øen≈øe of your own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thine≈øs, you wil ≈øay; I was a wretched, and a great ≈øinner, and though I have but little in the world, yet any thing is too much for one that was ≈øuch a great ≈øinner as I was: you will be Thankful for every thing, in every thing Thankful, maintain but this. Beloved! ye ≈øee how in all the≈øe troubles of the≈øe times, God hath given us our lives for a prey. As the Lord ≈øaid concerning <hi>Job. Only ≈øpare his life:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job,</hi> 2.6.</note> So hath the Lord ≈øaid concerning us, ≈øpare their lives. God did not deal ≈øo by our Saviour Chri≈øt: when our Saviour Chri≈øt came into the world, he met with hard dealing from wicked men, and his life went for it; he did not ≈øay, <hi>Only ≈øpare his life;</hi> his life went for it. You have more in this re≈øpect than our dear Saviour had: you have your lives given you for a prey in the≈øe evil times, our Saviour had not. Shall we not then be Thankfull in every thing? having more than our Saviour had in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect: ≈øhall we not be Thankful for any thing? for any thing that God gives us, ≈øhall we not now be Thankful? How many are there, that walke directly contrary unto this Truth that I have ≈øpread before you? <hi>In every thing Thankful,</hi> and they in nothing Thankful, in nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented: Husband godly; Children hopeful; E≈øtate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable; and yet never contented: Servants cannot plea≈øe, Children cannot plea≈øe, friends cannot plea≈øe; never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented: Oh! is this a duty, to be in every thing Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? how do they lie in a ≈øin, and the breach of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that are in nothing contented, never plea≈øed?
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:162405:127"/>Beloved! I don't now come to call for contentment, and patience, and quietne≈øs under Affliction; but for Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈øs: and not for thankfulne≈øs only when all goes well with you; but for Thankfulne≈øs in every thing. Oh! therefore, let us return unto our own ≈øouls, con≈øider how it hath been with us. If there be ever a di≈øcontented man or woman reade this Sermon: con≈øider this Scripture: The Lord ≈øaies, <hi>be in every thing Thankful,</hi> and thou ha≈øt been in nothing Thankful, in nothing contented in thy condition. Oh! how will you an≈øwer it at the great day? Let me leave this Exhortation with you, in your bo≈øoms: the Lord knows into what condition we may come; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into Affliction, or Per≈øecution, or De≈øertion, or of Temptation: Remember, here lies your duty before you; lay it up in your hearts: <hi>'Tis the will of God, even our Father, that we ≈øhould be Thankful to him in every thing:</hi> not in ≈øome things, not when things go well only; when we have Victory: but in all things Thankful: <hi>In every thing give Thanks unto God, for this is the will of God our Father concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you.</hi>
